taken care of by one of the night shift workers and was told, i wasn't supposed to get it done in the first place. (he actually was the one who did it for me, which he realized after his coworker told him.) i was told to come back another day because nothing could be done for me, so i went back the next day to see layla. i was sent to her. she couldn't do anything and began to get mad and yelled at me for being upset nothing could be done. she blamed this all on me and yelled and cussed me out as i was leaving the place. i was told \"to leave the fucking place and to never fucking come back along with other words\" honestly this was the most unprofessional experience ive ever received! i don't have any reasons to come back here or to ever refer anyone. would not recommend this place to anyone. fuck this shitty ass place that deserves to be shut down. i've never been treated so poorly as a customer. with how poorly i was treated and how poorly the service here was, i could only imagine how other customers were treated after coming back for problems. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.  would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.  would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.  would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.  would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.  would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.  would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.  would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.  would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.  would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.  would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend. would not recommend.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"]}}],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sql SELECT * from scores WHERE scores.sentiment = (SELECT max(sentiment) FROM scores)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .table-result-container {\n    max-height: 300px;\n    overflow: auto;\n  }\n  table, th, td {\n    border: 1px solid black;\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n  }\n  th, td {\n    padding: 5px;\n  }\n  th {\n    text-align: left;\n  }\n</style><div class='table-result-container'><table class='table-result'><thead style='background-color: white'><tr><th>review_id</th><th>sentiment</th><th>text</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>8lDyH3gcsG1qj86myTkF8A</td><td>-1</td><td>This place never ceases to amaze me.

One of my biggest pet peeves is when you go to a restaurant and  they ignore you, and that's just what happened.  I sat and sat until I saw one of the guys at the bar who I saw order his food get his dinner and finished it.  Honestly, I try to not judge a place off of one experience but after waiting for close to 25 min without even a hello, I doubt I will ever be back.  It wasn't even like they were super busy, I watched the bar tender and the other waitress talking it up with all the people at the bar a looked at me but never came over.

I never received a voucher nor a follow up call. Negative reviews are not good business clearly.

Secondly his calm presence, caring and understanding rivals a registered nurse's (and I know because I am one).  I think a lot of doctors would have become frustrated with my anxiety and fears, just wanting to get the procedure over and move on to the next patient.  However he took the time to allow me to focus and relax all the while maintaining his calm composure, never rushing me.  And once I was ready, he numbed my foot with the freezing spray while trying to hide the needle for the block from my view.  Had I not known what was going to happen I probably wouldn't have even noticed.  I felt only a bit of discomfort during the injection and when the procedure began, I felt nothing.  He talked me through it in distraction and before I knew it, I was done!  If I ever have to have another foot procedure again, I wouldn't hesitate who I would call and I, as a very nervous and scared patient, would urge everyone to seek his help.</td></tr><tr><td>gFUFNDX3GIlz2Ll9LChDvA</td><td>-1</td><td>Horrible, no taste, staff completely unknowledgeable about their menu and are RUDE...13 dollars for glue white sauce four little pieces of chicken and NO garlic bread ...its SHAMEFUL!</td></tr><tr><td>0SP_pBW0K_7V-9_7tfTxpA</td><td>-1</td><td>I went to this hair salon for the first time in the summer of 2010.

I asked for 2 inches cut off, she took 5 inches.  I asked for no hairspray, she used a ton of hairspray and lied saying it was a thermal water. The haircut is very old fashioned, with layers ranging from 6 inches in length to 20 inches (this is not the time of Jennifer Aniston anymore!). When I asked her to fix some kinks in her blow dry, she refused and insisted that it looked fine.  She then tried to charge an extra 15$ for the blow dry after the set! The entire time she was complaining that she was missing her appointment at the apple store.  I walked out in a ponytail and washed my hair as soon as I got home.  I will be in a bun for the next 2 months.  So, go there are your own risk.</td></tr><tr><td>XWZ7eoJglGeCpBCPHVbqgQ</td><td>-1</td><td>Wow.  This place has gone downhill.  I have stayed here before  (I come to Vegas often for work) but had not stayed here for several years as I liked other hotels better.  I had to put together a meeting for 20 people, and my company's travel department put us all up at Harrah's due to it's rate being best.  What a mistake.  All of the poor reviews are right.  Our poor experience started right away.  The parking lot looks like a third world garbage dump and does not feel safe at night.  Despite having at least 10 terminals for checking in guests, only three were on duty at the time of our check in.  Despite a long, long line, one of them left, and was not replaced!  40 minutes later, we got checked in.  Upon arriving in our room, we saw how dirty the room was.  After stepping out of the room to get ice, our keycard quit working, requiring ANOTHER 40 minute wait, causing us to miss our dinner.  After a night on the \"premium memory foam bed\" (quotes added for sarcasm) I left for work.  later my wife called to tell me the toilet was overflowing and had taken no less than 3 calls to get it fixed.  At the office my co-workers complained of smells, bugs, AC that didn't work, noise problems, etc.  I have two more nights here and I can only imagine the problems we will have.  The place is a dump.  Stay somewhere else.</td></tr><tr><td>jCsUlAOOPsrT2SNDLhB_HQ</td><td>-1</td><td>First of all this place has great food and quality. My family enjoyed their food a lot. But, \n\nThey have horrible service. When we came around 6:30, they told me that it was going to take an hour and 40 minutes. But when my mom asked again around 6:50, they told us that it was only going to take 20-30 minutes. It was dinner time and we were all hungry. My mom got up to just look at the waiting list to see when our turn was and the waitress who was in front of my mom gave my mom an unpleasant look and started talking to the waiter next to her saying \"That lady won't just sit down and she keeps wandering in front of us\" like my mom was some annoying person who's just randomly annoying her. First of all, my mother is not just \"that lady\". She is your customer and despite the fact that we are in a restaurant, isn't it just straight up rude giving someone who you don't know at all a nasty look and talking about them? I was just so mad and shocked about how they treated my mother. \n\nIt was just my mom, my brother, and I who went to eat. As I was eating, I can see and hear with my two eyes and ears that the servers were asking around \"How was the food?\" or \"How is it going so far?\",yet all we got was \"Are you guys done eating?\" like they wanted to kick us out and bring in new customers. I know. Dinner time is very busy and they had a lot in their minds but they were treating us like we weren't going to pay and just take off or like we've been staying there for hours which none of it is true. Those services just started to make me think \"Is it because they see my mother as a single mom or something?\" or because it's just two weak women and some 7 years old kid. \n\nEating dinner outside with your family means having a meaningful time outside with your family by spending money. I am not sure what my mom did to deserve this kind of service but it was terrible and I was just so furious.</td></tr><tr><td>5a1yqmxnpfdSlk_e6uGmoA</td><td>-1</td><td>Saw this shop after visiting Five Guys and was drawn in because i can't resist a cupcake.

We saw server after sever pass by without saying anything  or acknowledging us. Husband started the timer on his phone and after 2 minutes three different people said they would be right with us. That is when I started to really look around at the other customers and see that many were sitting at a table with no drinks or trying to flag down someone. After the four minute mark someone approached us and asked us if would come back in 15 minutes. What?! I have never had a place of business ask me to come back. At the very least seat me throw some chips and salsa and water and when you get around to me that is fine, I am not very picky.

I've had the car for 3 years and I've never done the brakes so, although it was a bummer, it was not unexpected. They made every effort to make sure I was able to afford the repairs needed and get me back on the road safely the same day!

Being from Miami, I love Cuban food and I haven't had it in a long time. The food is amazing; so much that I went there for dinner the first night and breakfast the following two mornings. If there was a rating for service I would give it a 1. The first night we arrived at around 9:20 pm (they close at 10 pm). We got our appetizers, but still had not gotten utensils or napkins. We had to ask for water twice, once when we got there and once when the appetizers arrived. Note we were the only ones in there. For breakfast the next two days, the service got worse. On the third day we waited for 15 minutes after being seated until we ordered. Our waitress seemed to avoid us every time I tried to make eye contact.  Make sure you ask for water when you get there cause we waited about 20 minutes to get water.  Our food and coffee arrived first than our water; how do you explain that?  Bottom line, this was the worst service I have ever received, but for me alone the food was worth the lack of sevice. Unfortunately, I would definitely go again.</td></tr><tr><td>H06mE2JgnBp7ROEEWlqVAw</td><td>-1</td><td>So cheap, #3 Bun is my very favorite. I'm here 3 times a week, it's probably unhealthy.

The vet was very nice and showed me both the ultrasound and the x-rays. She explained that there are a couple types of bladder stones, one type that can be dissolved with a diet change and another that required surgery. There were no crystals in her urine so we couldn't tell which type of stones they were. We agreed on a diet change and another visit next month to see if the stones shrunk or disappeared. I made it clear that I didn't want surgery to be our first option, the procedure is very invasive, risky and expensive... so we tried the diet change and she gave us pain medication.\n\nFast forward to the next day, I called with a question and they were extremely rude and pushy, refusing to treat the UTI with antibiotics to make her more comfortable until we found a solution to the bladder stones. They told me that I'd just have to deal with my cat's discomfort and that there was nothing more they could do until I decided to schedule her surgery. They also told me that the food alone wouldn't show any results for at least 6 weeks, if at all and the only \"immediate action\" was surgery. Not true.\n\nThe phone conversation left me with a bad feeling, so I took her for a second opinion. The second vet treated her UTI with antibiotics and said that there was no reason why we couldn't make her more comfortable until we chose a course of action for the bladder stones. I felt that North Scottsdale Animal Hospital was trying to pressure me into a $2,000 surgery that could potentially be avoided altogether. The second vet also quoted me much less on the surgery if we end up having to go that route.\n\nThe vet and the reception staff were very friendly and helpful at first, until I decided against surgery. I have begun care for my cat elsewhere.</td></tr><tr><td>qeOmdsM5yXT8RArKpnyq7Q</td><td>-1</td><td>We use to love Joe's... Atmosphere/Service is the only thing that saved it from getting no stars!

My wife and I live in Ohio and we visit Vegas 2-3 times a year. We love the nightlife and the food scene in Las Vegas.  When we visit, our favorite thing to do is eat at nice restaurants. My wife's good friend is a gm at a restaurant in the bellagio and she said carbone was highly recommended. Our night started by us sitting down and waiting 10 mins for a table touchdown from our server. We ended up ordering drinks right after we got the menus and those took 20 mins to get. That might be understandable for a fancy mixed drink, but not for a bourbon and a glass of wine. After we saw our server again when he brought our drinks, we ordered salads and our entrees. We also ordered meatballs for an appetizer that never showed up. The salads showed up after 30 minutes and the Caesar was unbelievable. It just shouldn't have taken that long. About 15 minutes after our salads were finished our waiter came over to let us know that we couldn't have the tortellini because it wasn't good that night. We had to change one of our entree orders, so that made it take another 30 mins for our food to come out. Once the entrees were delivered we were still missing our meatballs. When our waiter finally came back over and we asked, he said he would get them out to us as soon as he could. We told him to forget it and he said \"that's good, because I think we are out of them.\" Our dinner experience ended up turning into a 3 hour nightmare. The food was great, the service was just terrible. We talked to the manager when we were on our way out and she could have cared less. We would love to give carbone one more chance because the food was so good but I don't even know if it would be worth the time or money.</td></tr><tr><td>mCx1Nfep9WWGprA1powvSw</td><td>-1</td><td>Had a very large takeout order so we were able to try many items.

He left the cream on my legs and then left and started doing a manicure for another person who had showed up after me. I wiped my legs clean asked about getting my nails done and he responded by telling me I didn't ask for that and I would have to wait another 30 mins.

We were politely warned upon arrival that the wait time after ordering would be about 30 minutes due to them having a small kitchen, which was fine with us. We had seen the reviews and were thrilled to try the food! We got seated immediately and were given waters and menus, and then were left alone for 30 minutes before we unfortunately decided to get up and go eat somewhere else. We saw lots of staff walking around and serving other tables--as a matter of fact, there was an employee wearing the Alo Cafe shirt chatting with the table next to us for at least 15 minutes. The food might be worth it, and I will probably never find that out for myself. Just wanted to share my birthday breakfast disappointment.</td></tr><tr><td>YYZCGX2PU7ttZ2AnOAWbZQ</td><td>-1</td><td>This place is nice enough.

They couldn't or wouldn't verify our insurance at the visit even when presented with insurance card and ID which oddly enough was valid at my dermatologist a few weeks later. This is a common Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and they never attempted to bill our insurance. When they sent us a bill, which we paid immediately, NOTHING in the long itemized list was coded, which has made getting reimbursed from our insurance impossible. By the way, the bill for four stitches was more than a thousand dollars. The physical wound healed but my wallet still hurts.</td></tr><tr><td>5Z4kz3htGiIpC0PNToCrbQ</td><td>-1</td><td>I had the throttle cable recall for my Ford Escape done here.

The elbow comes with a new PCV tube. Chapman replaced everything but the most fragile and worst part. So I paid for preventive maintenance but got less than nothing and had to spend part of my labor day weekend making a temporary repair while I wait for my regular mechanic to get back from their long weekend.

We arrived around 9:30, when they close at 10.  Which most places means they seat until 10.  They seemed annoyed that we were there that late, reminding us of when they close right away.  The dish that I usually got and thought was the best I had ever had at a Thai restaurant, was suddenly the worst.  There was hardly any meat and instead of putting brocoli in it, it was littered with little stubs from the stalks.  It was basically a plate of few noodles and tons of little brocoli stems.  When they saw I didn't like it and I told them why, they just brushed it off and didn't do anything to resolve the issue.  Too bad, I really liked the place and had been there at least 10 times, and now never again.  Mostly because of how they didn't resolve my compliant.

The cut was uneven and they couldn't fix the color so I had to come in a third time to have the color corrected.  I had to pay over $200 for all of this and was left with a bad color, cut and damaged hair.

Common terms associated with the Mills are \"ghetto\", \"unsafe\", \"sketchy\", etc, but I feel that it's just the stigma associated with this part of town. Yes, the mall itself looks a little run-down, but I think the managers are making an effort. The food court was recently remodeled and I think that new upgrades are in the works. However, I consider it one of the best malls in the area, beating out the Phoenix Premium Outlets in terms of price and variety. As a woman, I have never felt threatened or creeped out, but if you truly are concerned, just go with a friend during the day. \n\nPros:\n-a ton of different stores; there's something for everyone\n-you don't need to look hard for good deals: they're everywhere!\n\nCons:\n-the salespeople in the center of the walkway can be kind of pushy, but just ignore them and keep walking\n-can get extremely crowded on the weekends and around the holidays</td></tr><tr><td>tZDDgV1pb4Hb4crlZ3GiGA</td><td>-1</td><td>The donuts, without a doubt, are scrumptious.

The food was simply not good. Bland, slightly burned--each dish lacked flavor. Charging the highest possible price for a restaurant week meal ($35 per person) was not at all justified.  The ambiance was also quite strange--it was very dark in the restaurant and there was no warm lighting. The goal of restaurant week is to introduce people to a restaurant in the hopes that they will return.

Your adorable signage, really great live entertainment and quality service simply could not make up for your terrible product. I'm not being sarcastic when I say \"didn't you do market research?\" To begin with, Lucilles is just down the street. Lucilles. The place where you can get 90% of the things you have listed on your menu at a better price, better quality, in bigger portions and with better flavor. Also, you're marketing to patrons of Tivoli village. The people who go to Tivoli are looking for upscale or at least unique dining experiences. Finally, did you not consider the fact that you're opening a restaurant in Las Vegas, a place where world class dining experiences are available 24/7 nearly anywhere you go?\nI'm just so confused why you would start the dining experience with a laminated piece of paper that you clearly printed off your home computer and call it your menu? Really, its like the first thing your guests see. Then you under cook the complementary biscuits? Those are really important items that set the tone for the whole dining experience. I can think of several restaurants that I say \"ohh lets go there, the complementary _______ (bread, biscuits, chips etc.) are so delicious.\"\nLuckily with all these warning signs by the time my entree arrived I was prepared for the worst. My rubbery, maybe 3 oz, chicken breast sandwich on a store bought bun tasted like something I could have prepared in 5 minutes on my George Foreman grill. Members of my family suffered through their catfish that was still swimming (swimming in sauce that is) and pulled pork sandwich (admit it, the pulled pork was from Costco).\nI will say the cob, fried chicken and pecan salad was decent. Thank goodness as that's what the culinary south is known for, right, salad? Where is the roll eye emoji when I need it?!\nSo. Why am I being so mean? Because!! I want nothing more than for people to be successful. I say it repetitively throughout my reviews. However, people can be so stupid! This restaurant is disappointing and just the worst and now when it fails the person or people who made the investment are going to be all \"Wahhh! I failed at business feel sorry for me and let me go bankrupt and leech off of all the people in the world.\" \nWhen you closed your eyes and envisioned your business, is this seriously what you saw? And when you saw this in your vision, you honestly thought \"yeah, that's the kind of place that's going to last?\" You did this to yourselves people. You had potential. You could have done it. Somewhere along the line though you decided to go cheap, boring, lazy or you forgot to go to culinary school.

The lady that answered had no personality and is border line rude. First, she tells me its going to be 30 minutes for my order, and then after I ordered it it went down to 15. I dropped by there 25 minutes later to pick my food up, Surely it would be done right? WRONG! I patiently tried to wait, but after 15 minutes past the 25, I walked up to find out what was going on. The same lady that answered the phone waited on me with rolling eyes and attitude. No apology or anything. Sadly for me the guy had just dropped the chicken for my order .Now its 45 minutes later. There was no sense of urgency, as I watched the cook walk back and forth leaving the kitchen doing absolutely nothing. After just about an hour my original 15 minute order was done. Something told me when I went to the car to check my food.The order was wrong.I went back inside so frustrated at this point that I asked for my money back. My appetite was gone at this point .Again, no apology, just a look of bewilderment, and asking me what's wrong with the food. The lady continued on to tell me that she had to call someone to come in to return my money! What kind of business are these people running, where the employees have to call someone to drive in for a refund? Yea I really want to wait another hour to get my money back. Absolutely absurd. Long story short. Horrible staff,no organization and sadly I wouldn't know about the food, but that the order was wrong. Another word of advice to this place, get your peach cobbler of the lowest rack near the floor. That has to be some kind of health issue. I wouldn't even take it for free when they tried to give it to me, for all of my trouble. Hilarious!  I did forget to add that part.</td></tr><tr><td>WRsPqqEZlvHUIYzh8X3j4Q</td><td>-1</td><td>The best dentist I've ever been to. The staff is friendly and very professional.

Which is why I have to provide only a 4 star rating. Staff was friendly but a little slow which was understandable due to the size of our party on the patio. I never received the extra side of cream cheese that I requested but luckily my buddy had some left over.

Brought the pizza home to find it was only a cheese with chicken pizza soaked in buffalo sauce. For someone who loves buffalo sauce enough to order an extra side of it, the food wasn't even edible. Per the Yelp menu, the chicken is tossed in the buffalo sauce not the entire pizza. It was also missing the ranch and onions that were supposed to be on it. The blue cheese side tasted spoiled. The food was such a disappointment that I almost called to ask for my $20 back. Super bummed that this place is not consistent with the food they make.

It wasn't until my friend showed up until we were greeted and asked for drinks. We knew what we wanted so we ordered our food at that time too. The meal did come out timely even with the lunch rush. (Earned one star). However, we noticed instantly that there was a long black hair in the coleslaw. No one came back to refill our drinks or ask how the meal was. We were forced to eat the remaining part of our meals while the black hair in the food started at us. The salad plate and side dish were stacked on top of each other at the end of our small 2 person booth. No one stopped to pick it up. We waited and waited for the server to come by so we could get out check. I eventually had to flag down another server to help find ours. At that time we made him aware of the black hair, requested that side item to be removed off the bill. He finally removed those dishes from the table but left our other food plates in front of us. \nThe manager came by (2nd star earned) apologized and removed an entire meal off the bill. He was the one that removed the last of the remaining food plates. \nIt took us 1 and a half hours to eat lunch and check out at this place.

He explained to us that this man was a regular customer and was not right in the head. Dismissed us and when back to his office. I am concerned that this is a kid friendly restaurant where management isn't concerned with the safety of the small children or other paying customers.  We didn't even receive an apology. \nBe aware this is not a safe environment and this was an intense/scary situation that I would not like to see happen to anyone else.

The interior looked so elegant in photos that I was excited when my friends agreed to have our New Years Eve dinner there. Unfortunately, Ive never had such a disaster of a dining experience in my life...\n\nOne of our friends had to leave early so we made the reservations for 5pm (right when they open). Needless to say it was empty when I got there. When making the reservation, I had requested one of their posh godfather booths. The waitress was very accommodating even though we were only a party of 3. She did inform me that a large group would be arriving at 6.45pm and requested that same table. We agreed however that if our dinner took a little longer we would move to a smaller table for our desserts/coffee. \n\nI arrived on time as I normally do and waited for about 10 minutes for my first friend to arrive. As the hour approached 5:15th...things got weird. The waiter was getting very anxious and pissed that we had yet to order anything but since our third dinner companion was running late we didn't want to start without her. The manager (I'm guessing that's who he was) stopped by our table to AGAIN give us a heads up that they would be needing the table at 6:45pm and we were welcome to move to a smaller table if need be later on.Â \n\nSo I'm very puzzled as to why when 5:20pm approached and our last friend arrived the waiter became aggressive and pushy for us to order even before we were able to say our hello's. The hovering over the table and tension was palpable. It made us all incredibly uncomfortable but we tried to not let it bother us. We ordered our drinks right away. When the waiter came back to take our food order 3 minutes later we were reminded yet AGAIN that they would be needing this table for a 6:45 party. They created the most uncomfortable and unwelcoming experience Ive ever had. You would have thought Barack Obama were arriving after us. This is how nervous, tense and hostile the environment around us became.Â \n\nThe waiter was unprofessional for many different reasons that I won't even go in to. I don't think he has the necessary social skills for this kind of job. He was saying and doing awkward things (like putting his hand on my friend's plate to remove a lemon wedge). It was just very strange behavior. \n\nThe manager didn't have the proper people skills either when we told him how unwelcome we were feeling. We skipped our last dish which was taking forever to come out of the kitchen (which makes no sense if you're trying to get us out at a certain time) and just asked for the bill. We were gone before 6.45pm and they got their precious table back. \n\nIt was the most unprofessional and absurd service I've ever experienced to date. I'll be curious to see how long this place runs with this kind of management and staff.</td></tr><tr><td>YVYNeex6MArmCnRxkqbzlQ</td><td>-1</td><td>I was expecting more based on the good reviews I saw, but it was a disappointment.\n\nI know this is a hole in the wall place and I didn't expect anything fancy - after all, it's the food that matters.

I didn't have the menu so I relied on the person on the phone. They said they didn't have soup with the lunch, so I ordered a small cup of Tom Yum soup. I asked an eggroll and they said they don't offer it with lunch, so I ordered whatever eggroll option they had. I ordered also a Pad Thai. When I received the order, the bill was $ 28 ! I called back to see whether there was a mistake. The owner lady said the soup is $ 9, eggrolls were $ 7 and Pad Thai was $ 12 ! What does this restaurant think with these crazy prices for a weekday lunch order? Later I found out from their menu that their lunch menu has no additional items like soup or eggrolls, in fact it is only an entree with prices $ 9 and up. So they charged me full price for everything. Who thinks that $ 9 is a fair price for a small cup of soup? We went to this place in the past but we will never go again.</td></tr><tr><td>pDItzfznKMc9uIM3m8WC-Q</td><td>-1</td><td>I recentley went to Petals florist as i was walking by,never knew it was here. the staff was very freindly and informed me thet were under new owenership. \nI tried them out for a arrangement for my grandmothers birthday and it was absolutley Beautiful!!!!  I had it delivered and it was on time and the best thing about it was that it was beautiful and the price was very reasonable.  as i read these reveiws its sad that the new owners are taking the heat for how the old owners ran there business.

From the exterior, it looks like a halfway decent place.  Upon entering, we found it old and a little disorganized.  It wasn't clear where we were supposed to go to check in and get a table.  VERY few patrons in restaurant.  We were seated at a booth with very short benches and very straight backs - kindof uncomfortable, but not enough to ruin my experience.  We received the menu - the prices blew us away!  The selection was very run of the mill, nothing incredibly interesting, and there was not one steak under $20.  The menu itself was dated looking.  We ordered a provolone wheel as an appetizer, not knowing exactly what that meant, but it literally was a round slab of cheese lightly breaded with a sandy and oily breading and was warm at best.  It's really an odd appetizer.  Our meal itself was okay, but our waitress was hit or miss in her personality... A little gruff at times.\n\nOverall, it's clear this place has seen better days, and we couldn't help but remark that it seemed like a good candidate for \"Kitchen Nightmares\" the TV show.  We won't be returning.</td></tr><tr><td>t4qRjzPDOMEWJUswLgwdFA</td><td>-1</td><td>PLEASE save your time and money do not go to this restaurant it is absolutely horrible.The food was dry and barely warm.Not only that,it was sooooooooo noisy because there was 2 other parties taking place at the same time I could barely make out what my friend was saying right next to me.Service was slow,not enough servers and way too many guests.First and last time going there!</td></tr><tr><td>9s0O0pILxsCSNsPxvBuDdg</td><td>-1</td><td>I love Popeyes chicken but the service here is consistently and painfully slow.

Avec un menu des plus classiques, on y retrouve le mÃªme genre d'assiettes de cÃ´tes levÃ©es, filets (''tendres'') de poulet, burgers trop gros, coupes New York 12oz etc. Pour les plus petits appÃ©tits ou budgets, vous serez assurÃ©ment satisfaits avec une salade au steak et fromage bleu (~15$), leur sandwhich au thon (15$) ou encore les linguini aux fruits de mer (~20$). \n\nPour les Gourmands comme moi,  c'est les Ã©normes poitrines de poulet, burgers et l'excellent steak coupe NY 12 oz avec fromage de chÃ¨vre (~34$) qui vous attendent. Pour y Ãªtre allÃ© quelques fois en groupe, le choix le plus populaire semble Ãªtre le duo de Filets de poulet et CÃ´tes levÃ©es (~22$). J'ai personnellement prÃ©fÃ©rÃ© les cÃ´tes levÃ©es du Madison's, celles du Firegrill Ã©tant un peu fades, mais pas autant que les horribles cÃ´tes du Keg... Bref.\n\nAmateurs de l'ocÃ©an, quelques choix de poissons et fruits de mer s'offrent Ã  vous. L'assiette de Filet de saumon propose une gÃ©nÃ©reuse portion de saumon bien grillÃ© (~20$), avec un choix de sauce TÃ©riyaki ou  beurre citronnÃ© Ã  l'aneth. Ã ma derniÃ¨re visite au Firegrill, j'ai essayÃ© le Bar de mer Chilien (~27$) qui s'est avÃ©rÃ© pas mal caoutchouteux et huileux, malgrÃ© sa bonne consistance et la salsa d'ananas qui matchait parfaitement. \n\nLes desserts consistent aux gÃ¢teaux habituels qu'on retrouve dans la plupart des restos (~7-10$, gÃ¢teau chocolat, fromage, carotte, crÃ¨me glacÃ©e, etc). Rien d'impressionnant, mais Ã§a complÃ¨te bien le souper. Tant qu'Ã  Ãªtre au centre-ville, je vous conseille d'allez faire un tour au Cacao70 pour vous sucrer la dent.\n\nSERVICE/AMBIANCE: Sur la dizaine de fois oÃ¹ j'ai mangÃ© au Firegrill, j'ai eu droit Ã  un service typique ''centre-ville'', soit rapide, relativement efficace, oÃ¹ ils vous portent l'attention au dÃ©but pour prendre vos commandes, mais peuvent disparaÃ®tre par la suite... jusqu'Ã  ce que vient le moment de rÃ©gler la facture. Rien de trop grave, par contre. Grand resto avec une dose de chic, moins sombre que le Keg, mais une petite coche plus moderne que BÃ¢ton Rouge et ses banquettes bourgognes de 1992.\n\nCOOL : Place idÃ©ale pour les groupes, beaucoup de places, parking intÃ©rieur gratuit avec achats de 40$ et +, aprÃ¨s 5pm, bonne alternative aux autres steakhouses.\n\nBOF : PrÃ©sentation simpliste des plats et  service Ã  amÃ©liorer lÃ©gÃ¨rement, mais encore une fois, rien de terrible.</td></tr><tr><td>yTXjx8gbjeWSSQuu3QtopQ</td><td>-1</td><td>Good food, but awful atmosphere.\n\nMy husband and I were disappointed with our dinner at Crave Cafe & Lounge. We went to dinner around 8pm. Immediately after ordering, the staff began whisking away all of the tables around us. One waiter told us not to worry -- it was \"ok\" if we ate in the restaurant. Apparently, the lounge turns into a club at night and if the place isn't busy, they just break down the tables early, even if people are trying to eat dinner. To escape this, we decided to eat in the back patio area. This didn't really help, since that same waiter who spoke to us before nearly hit my husband in the head with a table.\n\nThe food was tasty, but given the terrible atmosphere/experience, I wouldn't go back.</td></tr><tr><td>ce3rcy4OolpSOhHDsOUFWQ</td><td>-1</td><td>First-- they don't serve hookah anymore :(\n\nJust an average martini bar.

Pizza came around 4:00, and it was the wrong order. \n\nCalled them and they had no idea what was going on. Frustrated, I hung up on them and ate the pizza anyway, but it just tasted awful.

Called to speak to manager and cashier had major attitude & said she didn't know managers name.. I heard the other girl in the background saying our managers name is VERONICA. Yet, she insisted that she will not give out the managers name so I could make a complaint. People of Avondale support other local restaurants that care about service.. There are better places that will respect its customers and be happy to serve you.. Sassy attitudes will be its own downfall.  Support hard workers wanting to succeed by choosing a better restaurant..This place is a major joke to small restaurant establishments trying to make it. Simple rule for cashier servers.. If you don't like your job or customer service isn't your thing.. Find a job that fits you,  stay out of the service industry or have a fake it till you make it attitude.</td></tr><tr><td>eNKFknAxXVz2xHlnd35uaQ</td><td>-1</td><td>DO NOT go to this place for lash extensions! i cannot comment on the threading but i have been wearing lash extensions for years and this is the worst ive encountered. the glue that is used is not appropriate for lashes and not to mention the lashes itself are not a good quality. i would never recommend anyone there for lashes its almost scary to think what that stuff can do to your actual eyes.</td></tr><tr><td>ZTbpIq52FGFswhMbfA-5Bw</td><td>-1</td><td>The food isn't terrible (I got the eggs Benedict with cornbread), but being from the U.S. it's not really authentic (obviously!!!); it's more so a fusion of soul food meets Caribbean food just thrown together. The name itself threw me off (Harlem is in the North NOT the deep South). A good litmus test is to always try the mac and cheese. The cheese was literally non-existent! Just because someone puts a little dish in the oven with a little bit of cheese on top of to make it look pretty DOES NOT turn it magically into mac and cheese. \n\nHonestly, if ya'll want some decent mac and cheese, you're better off going to the Evergreen Brick Works restaurant (I would say they have some good mac and cheese for sure). And just to keep it real, there was hardly any black folk up in there (another good indicator). The food could MOST DEFINITELY be better even though it's not truly authentic.\n\nThe service was pretty bad too. Our waiter kept forgetting our drink orders and a side order. However, he did show some remorse so I still gave a pretty decent tip. I didn't want to eat there in the first place, but my friend wanted to try it. But, I most certainly will never return!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>lXY1it0vHpGDpnTCdd5Alw</td><td>-1</td><td>I spent quite a bit of time in the Hilton Toronto and don't have any real complaints.  It's an above average standard Hilton with all the amenities and services you would expect from this chain.  \n\nThe hotel exterior is aged, but the lobby is modern and well maintained.  The front desk agents are efficient and cordial - you never have to wait long.  There are a number of seats to relax in the lobby while waiting for coworkers/friends.  The hotel restaurant/bar was on the other side of the lobby and appeared to be always packed (I never went).    And on the lower level, there was a Ruth Chris steakhouse in case you wanted a good slab of meat but didn't want to walk far.  \n\nSome of the rooms were updated which gave them a quasi-boutique hotel feel.  They tended to be somewhat cramped and the bathrooms could have used a little more space. Every now and then, I'd check in to a room that had a minor problem like a broken stopper or a non-working phone.  Housekeeping was attentive but they'd occasionally miss the little details like replacing shampoos or towels.  The executive lounge was very large and comfortable with a great view of the city:  There was a reasonable variety for breakfast and evening snacks.  And most important to me, the beds at the Hilton Toronto were very comfortable, almost Westin quality.  \n\nYou can't beat the location:  The hotel is a 2 block walk to the subway and streetcar. You are also within a 3 block radius of a bevy of good restaurants.    Overall, I'd recommend staying at the Hilton Toronto if you are points-hound like I am and want convenience to the city.</td></tr><tr><td>QDOECVMnDb9izRHh77XOCA</td><td>-1</td><td>I walked by Fuzen and noticed it was a quaint, well-lit, unassuming place.  I was in the mood for sushi and they had good reviews, so I decided to give it a whirl.  I'll try to temper my review with the fact that it was a Tuesday and after 8p, so maybe they were a bit \"off.\"\n\nThe sushi itself was decent.  It was slightly less than fresh, but perhaps that was due to it being the end of the day. I ordered one of those sushi/sashimi combos and it was reasonably priced.  The size of the sushi and sashimi was about average and the variety in that combo not so diverse (mostly salmon with only 1 tuna nigiri).  However, they did give you miso soup, a small salad, and a sample of their crunchy noodle soup which helped to pass the time while you waited for your sushi.  \n\nIf I had one true complaint, it was about the service.  It was inattentive and distracted.  They had a number of take-out orders, so the staff was preoccupied with filling those.  I had to flag down the waitress a couple of times just for a refill of my water.  Perhaps that was due to it being the end of the evening, but the service was still disappointing.  Overall, Fuzen was satisfying:  I'd give Fuzhen 3.5 stars for creating a comfortable space with a decent selection of sushi and Japanese foods. I'll give them another try because maybe it was an \"off\" night.</td></tr><tr><td>i2FJYfiRA3qWl9RqRBcufQ</td><td>-1</td><td>I've stayed at the Renaissance Downtown a number of times and it's a reasonable hotel. Very standard Renaissance - no surprises when you walk in the lobby or enter your room. The rooms are slightly larger than your standard downtown hotel and have decent sized flat screen TVs. The furniture is average, very typical for a Renaissance although it does have a comfortable work space.\n\nService at the Renaissance Downtown is good but not flawless. The check in process is easy and the front desk staff is quite helpful. And breakfast/snacks in the lounge are good although the lounge seems to be spread out too far and not that many tables. If I had to knock it down a point, it would be for\n\n- A lot of rooms are a hike from the elevators\n- The hotel is attached to the ballpark, making game nights a very loud and raucous affair (with drunk fans screaming in the hotel hallways)\n- Not many restaurants in that part of town, so you'll have to walk a number of blocks\n\nOtherwise, if you are working on the west end of downtown, the Renaissance is a decent hotel for business travelers.</td></tr><tr><td>8ZPXMsfbfofpoh1foBX0sw</td><td>-1</td><td>Wow what a messy store!

However, this last trip I had was the absolute worst. The waitress was rude, and unhelpful as far as her knowledge about the wines were concerned. Our food took 45 minutes to and hour to arrive, and it when it did, it was so unappetizing. Not to mention the fact that I had ordered two glasses of wine and the waitress \"forgot\". All the pasta dishes at the table (there were five of us), were cold and had that hardened look to it that pasta has when it's left out too long.The only item that we ordered that came out decently, was the calamari. We did bring this to the attention of the manager, who was very nice and gave us 50% off of our whole meal. I was just extremely disappointed with the service, and don't plan to return to this location again.</td></tr><tr><td>nJGO8cr4nwctqXOe82oHXQ</td><td>-1</td><td>Cynthia's is just down the street from us and we have ordered there a few times.\nMy in laws order there more often, they like celebrating birthdays with Peking duck.\n\nUnfortunately tonight was the last night we will give them our business.\nMy spouse and I are vegetarian and order the same things every time\n\nTonight we ordered fried rice, spicy eggplant, and OK tofu. When she confirmed the order I have to admit I couldn't fully understand her over her accent but it sounded close enough.\n\n\nMy husband ran in to grab it and we hurried home excited and hungry.\n\nOh no they gave us squid not eggplant and we are vegetarian so we can't just make do. Not a big deal we will call have them make an eggplant and pick it up in 10 take back the untouched squid.\n\nTo my disappointment we were met with staff who said in the few seconds since we called they already reviewed the conversation and you said squid. \n\nFirst of all I'm vegetarian I can assure you I don't accidentally order meat and fish.\n\nSecondly who cares if I did? We are regular customers and it's a $7 eggplant, surely she couldn't be serious?\n\nThen she tells him he should be more careful next time? \n\nI obviously assumed a manager would never lose our business over a $7 eggplant and ask for him.\n\nBen comes on, pretty much laughs while talking over me the whole time, tells me she is best employee is broken English and is ok to lose our business. \n\nSo I advised me I regret is choice, will not be back and will ensure my friends neighbours and family don't either as well as mention him specifically in my reviews. He stated this is ok happily as well.\n\nToo bad, the food was pretty good if he just said sorry and let me get the eggplant I would still spend my money there.</td></tr><tr><td>nTosDizU2OeJbeoMx053Uw</td><td>-1</td><td>AVOID THIS FACILITY - some of the staff are great - but ASST Director of Nursing PHYLLIS VISCONTE is HORRIBLE and should have her license revoked.

My mom was in town for my birthday and we decided to celebrate by going to get crab. While we were waiting in the line to get he crab I commented to my mother that the crab looked different than normal. When we got back to our table and tried it it was the WORST crab I've ever had. I tried a few clusters to make sure it wasn't a fluke. It was super watery, hard to get to and a lot of the segments were empty. All we could get was broken up soggy mush. Normally I get nice big whole pieces out. I was so disappointed that I asked someone who looked like a supervisor or manager and they said that they have gotten many complaints and that they tried it themselves and it was awful. I asked how long they would have this horrible crab so that I wouldn't come back until it was gone and she explained that they buy 10,000 lbs at a time and it will lay 3-4 months. It just amazes me that they still charge the same price for such poor quality crab. I warned all of my friends not to go for a while. I will definitely return when the crab gets back to normal, but for now I'll go to the grocery store and make it at home.</td></tr><tr><td>iX_jz4g1fNGN8XKDhsi5NQ</td><td>-1</td><td>Zero stars or less.

We called customer service in the afternoon to check the status of our call and were informed the tech would arrive at 445pm. We called again at 5pm and were told someone would be here by 630pm. Again, no show, no call. Called customer service once again and were informed our order had not been \"pulled\", meaning a tech never got it. We were assured a tech would be here next morning between 8am and noon. When we called at 8am to get status, they said we were scheduled for the following week - a full 7 days later. Don't let me forget to mention that in just 2 days we have spent countless hours on the phone being put on hold and being transferred from one person to another. So we've been lied to about appointments and given the runaround by customer service. Is this some kind of customer service strategy to put us off and hope we go away before anyone has to work?

Worst waiter ever. \n\nLet me start by saying my family is always very respectful to wait staff, we always say please and thank you and help clean up our plates at the end of the meal. \n\nOur first time, and probably last time, at Thirsty Goat with my family of 4 at 1140am(not lunch rush) on a Saturday.  \nAfter being seated and waiting an additional 10 minutes or so for waiter to show up, we ordered our drinks and luckily our food at the same time. It took a total of 25 minutes for our drinks to show up ONE at a time. I noted that our waiter spent a lot of time talking to the 2 bartenders. At this point my husband went up to the bar and patiently told them that it had taken along time just for drinks and that we hoped it wasn't going to take an excessive amount of time for our meal, that we need to be somewhere at 1pm. I had ordered water with lemon, in addition to my other drink, and that never came so I went up to the bar and nicely requested a glass of water, the bartender asked \"Where are your seated?\" \"Who is your waiter?\" I told her it was a man and that it had taken 25minutes to get my drink so I decide to get my own water.  Then the other bartender Rudely stated that my drink had been ordered incorrectly by the waiter and she had to remake it (which still shouldn't have taken 25min) and we had ordered broasted chicken that took 20 minutes to cook (which should be noted on the menu or at least told to the customer ).  I calmly asked her to send the manager to our table.  Our food finally arrived and it was good, which is unfortunate because I doubt many people will return if they continue with this kind of service, I highly doubt we will.  When the manager arrived she seemed slightly put out, hesitant, and uncertain of how to react and handle the recount of our experience. She eventually told us that she would remove the cost of our drinks from the bill and offered free dessert which we turned down.  Just an overall uncomfortable experience.</td></tr><tr><td>Szf3p2YK5uMF3eHMANloXA</td><td>-1</td><td>If there is one thing you should avoid is actually staying the nite at this hotel.

Our server didn't greet us until 15 minutes later & we had a difficult time ordering because she couldn't hear us. It was annoying that they wouldn't bother to ask the dj to lower the volume at least a bit. We ordered & got our drinks about a couple minutes later. Waiting another 15 mins or more we headed to the restroom & it looked like you had just walked into an abandoned highschool restroom. There was dirty toilet paper everywhere, cracked mirrors, and writings all over the walls and stalls.

The lady told me I was wrong and it must have been the method of previous threaders and then went on to boast about their special tools and why they're so superior. They claim their hand held device is more hygienic than using the mouth but what does it matter so long as that thread doesnt touch your skin? More importantly I didn't see her use sanitizer and I didn't feel her hands were clean which is truly the key. After beating up my face and doing exactly what I asked her not to do, I could sense the panic from her as she saw my face was now beet red. She grabbed some ridiculous device that looks like it's from the opening credits of The Xfiles, and claimed it would \"oxygenate\" my skin and help with irritation. The thing was electrically charged and honestly was pretty uncomfortable and most certainly made the problem worse. I could tell she was trying to hide her panic even as I left knowing she screwed up. I forgot about this place until I just found their business card. Big mistake giving to me because it reminded me to expose your business for the quacks you are. YOURE NOT DERMATOLOGISTS!

I had small alternations done at Sew Creative and they were fine. But I brought in a \"challenge\" then long story short, my jacket is now crooked, one side hangs lower, has different sleeve lengths, one of the collar curls up. In one word, unwearable. After identifying the problems I still contacted Marcia hoping to work it out with her, but guess who will not stand behind her work? It's been over a month since I last texted her so I'll have to find another tailor to fix it and it will never be what it could have been.\n\nI don't know if Marcia was lying to me the whole time to make her job easier or she's just not smart enough to do creative work. My jacket is all flat cut so it should be easy to alter. The jacket had a crossover neckline (one side goes on top of the other) and I wanted to make it a symmetrical zipper jacket. After the alternation one side hung lower on me, Marcia kept telling me it was because one side had embroidery so it was stiffer and heavier, and she promised that the jacket was symmetrical when laying flat. I trusted her completely and even apologized for bringing in a difficult piece. Well it turns out it isn't symmetrical when laying flat.\n\nAfter taking the jacket home and examining it myself, I realized after cutting the excess fabric off on one side, the collar points didn't match. Instead of discussing how to fix it with me, the tailor of the year decided to just lift up the lower side and put the zipper on making the jacket crooked when not zipped, even though I told her many times that I only want the zipper for the look I will not wear it zipped. And when zipped there is extra fabric on one shoulder so still not wearable... \n\nNot to mention I had to push pretty hard for her to fix the slanted hem that she made. And when I told her the sleeves were different lengths, oh god the bullshit she tried to pull on me, I couldn't even repeat it because it made so little sense.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you have some small jobs or something you know exactly how it should be done, Marcia is probably OK. But anything that requires some thinking or takes time, don't go to Sew Creative.</td></tr><tr><td>YO8mjSHwPIMXLHaCsnWeyA</td><td>-1</td><td>I came here with my brother who was visiting from out of town.

I appreciated the foot massage, but the hand massage could have been longer :-) \n\nThe place is clean and the lady who did my nails showed me how they sanitize the tools.

You know when you go into a nail salon and they start speaking a language you don't know and you wonder if they are talking about you? Well, that doesn't happen here! They started speaking Chinese and then stopped and apologized to me to reassure me they were talking about something (I can't even remember what). That's never happened ever!

After cooking it up and presenting it to me, all of my meat disappeared.  No joke. I understand that with fish, they move it to the side because it cooks slower.  When they assembled it, it never made it back into my mix. \n\nI like other Mongolian places where you can hang out at the grill and watch the magic, plus interact with the chefs.

There was no attention to any curves or detail, everything was boxy, squared and sharp edged. For example the holy berries were squares. When I called to return the items, I was met with aggravation, hostility and denial. I was told I have to file my complaint online, so I did. I was then asked to take pictures of the decals and email the \"alleged\" issues to them, because they didn't believe me, so I did. They refused to refund the money, instead they sent me more shitty decals. I told them I didn't want them and wanted to return the new and old ones, but apparently they do not do refunds or returns at trendy wall designs. So now I have 2 sets of wall designs that will never see a wall of mine. I would truly be embarrassed to have these displayed.

There didn't seem to be *too* many people waiting before us, so we put our names on the list.\n\nWe waited probably 45 minutes, and were very glad that it hadn't gotten truly HOT out yet.  Once inside, the place looks even smaller than it did from outside.  We were seated at the bar, which honestly looked a lot less cramped than some of the other tables with \"large\" parties (read: more than 2-3 people).  I think the entire place might seat 20 people?\n\nWe were immediately asked for our drink orders (coffee, orange juice and water), then our food orders.\n\nI should have paid more attention to what my co-workers ordered (I know Hayden and Sheri shared an order of pancakes and bacon, and maybe something else, while John also had pancakes and something else with hash browns), but seriously?  Once my Belgian Waffle arrived, there was little room for me to pay attention to anything else.  \n\nI can't say I consider myself a connossieur of waffles or anything like that, but I've truly never tried another waffle that even comes close to comparing to this one.  The consistency was absolute PERFECTION!  It was crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and the texture was hearty enough to hold up to the (real!) butter and (real maple!) syrup I subjected it to.\n\nOh, yeah, I also had the thick-cut bacon.  It was just a little too peppery and a little too done for my taste, but it was still quite good.  John declared the hash browns to be the best he'd ever had, and the pancakes got the same pronouncement from Hayden and Sheri.\n\nService was spot-on and cheerful.\n\nThere's just a couple things I would change about Matt's if I had the opportunity:\n\nA) Expand.  With the demand, they could easily seat and serve twice or even three times as many customers and still have a wait on weekends!\n\nB) Get a public restroom.  My very first desire upon leaving was to find a restroom!\n\nC) Relocate.  Seriously, Austin needs a place this good!!!

So I checked with the Eat street (their delivery contractor), they said \"there was no delivery went through their record\". In conclusion, they just made brainless work on doing SINGLE delivery and forgot to place on delivery (but surprisingly they remembered taking my money) and just closed the restaurant for the day. Therefore, I waited 2 hours and eventually ordered from different restaurant.

So he knowingly put me in a room with no AC on a 105 degree day! I told him I was calling Expedia to get a refund, he said he would deny it when they call him. A disgusting room, a room with roaches and he wants to deny a refund because I didn't cancel within 48 hours prior to arrival.

However, if you like me, and expect a bit of service along with some protein in the morning, then avoid this place at all costs. I only have negatives for this place . . .let me count them out, from minor to major:\n1.  Long wait for this place even early in the morning, probably because early in the morning it's one of the few places that actually serves breakfast/brunch before 11.  This is actually a smart move by the owners and other places may want to consider following suite.\n\n2.  It's crowded and loud.  I realize this is a personal preference, but if I want a loud, crowded restaurant I'll just stay in New York.\n\n3.  Extremely limited brunch menu.  Besides pastries, there are only 5 things you can order. 5. That's it.  No extras or sides either.\n\n4.  Now you might think that one of those options would contain a smidge of protein, you know, like eggs or something.  Oh how wrong you are.  They should rename this place carb city. There are small traces of protein, but it's far outweighed by sugar or fat.  Some examples:\na. Chia seed pudding. This sounds healthy right?  Too bad they smother the chia seed pudding in jam then make it even more calorically dense and unhealthy by adding Muesli.\nb. Cuban sandwich.  Or their version of it.  Which is basically just cheese and a smidge of egg in between two thick pieces of bread.\n\n5. Now none of this would have mattered if not for this.  When I saw the options available to me I asked if they could add an extra egg to the Cuban sandwich.  To my surprise, they couldn't.  Seriously guys you can't add one damn egg to my order? Hell you could have cracked the egg open in a cup and given it to me uncooked.  That would have netted you an extra star for the effort.\n\nTLDR; totally overrrated place with limited options, no protein options, and no ability to make substitutions.</td></tr><tr><td>S0-C72bJA0TT64-8jjI8cg</td><td>-1</td><td>Called them before going there to make sure there was sashimi for lunch buffet.

Good luck sustaining your company with this dismal level of service.\n\nI called to schedule a reservation for pick-up from my hotel to the airport.  I made the call at 8:20ish and was told that I would be picked up at 9:30 to make my flight at midnight.  I was also told to be at the shuttle pick-up at 9:20.  I was at the designated shuttle area at 9:20 on the dot.  There are no other areas for shuttles to pick customers up at this particular hotel so I know this was the correct waiting area.\n\nAt 9:40, I called the operator to ensure that my shuttle was coming to pick me up.  She assured me that shuttle #440 would be there shortly but was running late.  No biggy...at that point, they were only 10 minutes late.\n\nAt 10:00, I called back to see what was going on.  The operator put me on hold to call the driver and then proceeded to tell me that he/she had been to my hotel but no one was there to be picked up.  I told her that I had been at the waiting area since 9:20 as instructed and NO shuttle #440 came by for a pick up.\n\nSo, someone was lying to her and it sure as heck was NOT ME.\n\nThe kicker is that she offered no solution, no accommodation, no service.  She told me that no one else was available to pick me up immediately and that it would be another half hour before someone would become available.  I asked if I accepted the service if they would comp my fare (a measly $7!!!!).  She said no and that the driver would not allow me on the shuttle without payment.\n\nIt turns out taking a cab is just as cheap, if not cheaper, without the hassle and stress.\n\nBottom line...UNRELIABLE SERVICE and UNACCEPTABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

The bar tenders were so busy cleaning up and trying to get out of there, they never came back to ask if I wanted anything.   Seriously, your job is to sell something.  On the other hand the jazz band was really really good.

So we went across the street to the mall for a more reasonable price of $70.\n\nThey were so nice there, we just assumed they were doing a good job.  Every single nail was crooked.  When I went to pay, I noticed and made her refile my fingers so they were even and presentable.  After sitting under the dryer for over 10 mintues and getting quick-dry spray, every single nail managed to smudge or chip.\n\nIt was truly the worst manicure & pedicure I've ever had.  Do not go to this place!</td></tr><tr><td>e__yigJZsUT_HdKMHeEy_w</td><td>-1</td><td>We have come here for years and after tonight, never again.  They are cheaping out, big time.  No automatic bread; we were asked if we wanted bread.  Prices are up, quantity is down and quality is down.  We could not taste (or see) any dressing on our Caesar salads, and the price was higher.  We were surprised by the menu prices; $11 for a small portion of pasta plus $5 for a meat topping.  We could have gone to a fancier place for that.  And $11 bucks for a small so-so pizza.  Our food did not arrive all at once and we were told that they could not cook moe than one pizza at a time.  Really?  Best to move on; things have gone south.  When they can no longer afford to offer mints on the way out, you know they have problems.  I would not have given even one star, but I had to click something to move on.</td></tr><tr><td>-A82PkAj90cIJUu-lI1KYQ</td><td>-1</td><td>Very inconsiderate and dishonest people are working in this company. I could not back out of my driveway for at least 10 mins because their people who were working on my neighbors yard, parked their truck and wood chipper all the way up and blocked my entire driveway in order not to block their paying customer's driveway. I honked and honked and while waiting, called the company's phone number on the truck. A female representative claimed their truck broke down and unfortunately, right in front of my house. And it's been there for a while now because they had to work on my neighbors yard earlier. First, I had not given her the address. Secondly, if the truck was there for a while, why haven't any tow or repair company show up?? As I was on the phone, 3 of their employees showed up, dragging their feet and DID NOT even apologize and started the truck WITHOUT a problem and drove 50 feet to the open curbside of my cul-de-sac!! They went back to work on my neighbor's yard. I realized the rep was giving excuses and chastised her for lying and she hung up on me.. I called back again and demanded to speak to their supervisor. They put me on hold for a long time and eventually young sounding man answered and apologized and said there is nothing they can do. Well, there is....if your truck is honestly broken down and is in the way of others, have the courtesy to have your worker inform the household and explain assistance will arrive shortly. The so-claimed supervisor over the phone, laughed and said perhaps....I do not care is there is any discount coupon available from this company. Personally,I will never pay a dime for services of a company who operates with such inconsideration and dishonesty!</td></tr><tr><td>4qU-LbaGjRvE0-ke_xnaWg</td><td>-1</td><td>The food was okay, just average flavors for a place so pricey.

We had a family of 6 and ordered with a young waitress.  We've waited about half hour and noticed it was odd that pho dishes could take this long so we asked when our food was coming and another waitress said it would be a couple of minutes.  We waited for another 15 mins and started to realize that the tables that came after us were getting served their food while we were still sitting and waiting for ours...this raised questions so i asked what seemed to be the more experienced waitress to look into our order and she confirmed that it would be a few more minutes.. As i continued to see dishes go out to other tables i thought to myself that this young and incompetent waitress probably lost our order somehow so i asked the waitress again to go and look to see if our order was even being made and in a minute she came back with the menu saying there is no order for us and who placed it.  We were extremely baffled that in the hour we waited, these waitresses did not have the common sense to check up on us and even the first time we asked them to check up on our order they did not tell us which means they didn't even check in the first place!! We got no apology from the manager as well as the young, incompetent waitress and we will never come back to this location.  Oh i also forgot to mention that 3 other tables left while we were waiting as they didn't have the patience we did.  \nI hope these asian restaurants can invest a little time to train their staff for a change.\nAlso i found it very poor business practice to offer their sizes in medium large and x-large only,  what a money grab! Pathetic attempt.</td></tr><tr><td>ILxZHW3rIPVFl6fUPAxJjw</td><td>-1</td><td>The AYCE is a joke.  While the quality of the fish itself is acceptable the actual sushi and handrolls are poorly made.  My spicy salmon handroll was a sliceof salmon with hot sauce slapped on it. You never get what everything you ordered without having to ask them to follow up, half the time you only get about 70% of what you ask for. The chicken teriyaki is incredibly dry.  For the price they're charging it really isn't worth it.</td></tr><tr><td>5Dt1fo-B4MBkOAIbjQlNKg</td><td>-1</td><td>3.5 but rounded up bc they deserve a better average than most other ayce places.  The quality of the food is solid and they have pretty good variety on their menu.  I did find that their blowtorch sushi was a bit overdone, some of the pieces were nearly cooked through and thats not what I expect with blowtorch sushi.  They also have a tendency to slather way too much sauce on some of their grilled items (mushroom, eggplant) that becomes too overppwering and kind of...goopey and messy.  I also found it strange that their vegetables are also ordered piece by piece, it makes sense for the other items but I was not expecting to be served a single slice of mushroom and a small section of asparagus.   I guess I know better now if I go again.</td></tr><tr><td>HuM38wAQy3252hOCgRnMAA</td><td>-1</td><td>Dont make the same mistake I made and let them open your safe in the back room while you wait in the lobby.

When I was given the contents a gun was missing. I insisted a few times it was there, but could not prove it obviously. It was uncomfortable.

I've never been inside and when I saw the English name \"Eat with Fun\", I came back home with the total opposite, I was definitely not having fun \"on the toilet\". Usually, I would question myself of what I ate through the day before making any accusations about the cleanliness or food from the restaurant but I can swear my life I did not get served clean/ fresh food from them. I called the two combination meal (BBQ pork and cuttlefish). That was my first meal of the day and I could not eat anything else after it. I was in and out of the washroom dozens of times and was on the urge of wanting to vomit. I'm not sure how much business this place gets but we were the only table that was being served in the afternoon on a Saturday. Very upset this happened to me as my Canada Day plans were ruined and I was bedridden for most of the day. This place is in need of a health inspection immediately.\n\n\nParking: Easy\nPrice: Paid $20 for 2 people\nService: Alright, think it's a family business ? \nClean: No, considering what happened to me. \nWould go again?: Not worth sitting in the toilet for hours.</td></tr><tr><td>j2zq0dIVx5hSQp5QX30ISg</td><td>-1</td><td>Recently we learned my daughter's Audi had a transmission problem. We took it to a well known transmission shop we have heard of over the years to obtain an estimate. The estimate was a couple thousand dollars. When we were ready to get the vehicle repaired we decided to call around to get a second estimate.  Many of the places we called said they do not work on German vehicles. I then googled and found German Transmission Company. \nWe met with Adrian, the owner, who drove the car and immediately diagnosed the problem. He explained in detail what was going on with the car and showed us the part he would have to replace. He gave us a little lesson on how the part works and why the vehicle was not running right. He told us what he would have to pay for the part and how much his labor charge would be. We did not share any information about our first estimate.  \nWhen all was said and done we paid less than half of the first estimate we obtained. Adrian began work that same day and went in the next morning, which was Saturday, to finish the job. We had the vehicle back running great within 24 hours. \nBoth my husband and I felt very confident in Adrian's abilities and honesty. It was so nice to have repairs done on a vehicle where you trust that the job was done right  at a fair price.  \nWe highly recommend Adrian and will refer our family and friends to him.</td></tr><tr><td>pZaBP1wMeSarcDGS2ldP0Q</td><td>-1</td><td>Another user asked what the spice level of my dish was.

Upon my arrival to the rental car counter, the car was ready for pick up and I was asked if I wanted to purchase their insurance coverage at $35 per day.  I totally forgot that I had already purchased the insurance through expedia so I ended up paying for insurance twice.  I figured I'd deal with this when I returned the vehicle but even then I ended up getting turned around at the airport, was on the verge of missing my flight, and when I did arrive at the correct terminal the wait line at the rental counter was too long so I was unable to speak with a customer service rep.\n\nThe vehicle - 5 stars\n\nI was given a brand new 2012 Nissan Versa.  The car was clean, fuel efficient, & very spacious for a compact vehicle (I''m 5'11 and had more than enough leg room even as my relatives who are also pretty tall sat behind me while driving).  It only had about 386km on it.  It drove smoothly and I had no issues at all with this vehicle.  \n\nThe GPS\n\nFor an additional $13 per day I rented the Garmin GPS unit.  It was one of the newest models and was extremely helpful.  I highly recommend renting the GPS unit if, like myself, your not familiar with the area you're set to drive around. This was my first time driving in Canada so the additional $13 per day was definitely worth the investment.  I saved time & money (using the GPS on my cellphone would've been quite costly).\n\nThe Bad\n\nUpon returning the vehicle to the airport & heading towards the terminal I realized that I left my jacket draped over the back of the driver seat & my cellphone either in the front passenger seat or tucked in the bag with the GPS unit. I was literally on the elevator (which is only a few steps from where I checked in the car) from floor P1 to floor P3 when I realized I left my belongings.  I took the elevator straight back down to P1 and when I got to the car I was told that it had already been cleared out.  My jacket & my cellphone were both gone and supposedly no one knew where to find the guy that cleared out the vehicle and nothing was recently placed in the lost & found {sigh}.\n\nI headed back to the terminal & checked in for my flight.  When I arrived at the gate, the gate staff assisted me in contacting the rental car company again to see if anything turned up & still nothing turned up.  One would think that because the rental car company had all of my flight information (name, phone number, flight number, etc) that if anything was left behind in the vehicle upon returning it they'd atleast make a courteous attempt to contact me at the gate but this never happened. So, not only did I end up paying for insurance twice, I no longer have my favorite denim jacket that I purchased a few years back and I had to spend $240 on a new phone.  Not to mention the loss of all of my pictures, music, and contacts that were stored on the phone {sigh}.\n\nOverall, I would rent from this vendor again because a majority of the mishaps were my fault.  I advise all of you out there who's considering renting a vehicle from this vendor to just make sure to triple check the car prior to leaving it after checking it back in and don't buy into the crapolla of needing a gas station receipt from airport road if the tank is already full.</td></tr><tr><td>z92cDfPjtizSErSLDQvAGQ</td><td>-1</td><td>the staff here is very unprofessional.  went there and a 6'4 drag queen tried to beat up my straight female friend.

Normally most docs give u a paper gown of some sort, nothing here. The patient chair still had used/crumbled paper from previous patient on it. Office looks older and definitely not updated. Waited in room another 15 mins... After half hour in room- got dressed and left. There goes a good two hours of my life ..... Never again</td></tr><tr><td>lQLQSyDZ11_wZx5bLIcLdg</td><td>-1</td><td>I would honestly give this place zero stars to express my anger and disgust with the service I received on 01/06/12 if yelp would let me. I had some acrylics nails that I wanted taken off and a regular manicure. I noticed this place on yelp and figured I would check it out because it is close to my house and had some decent reviews.  Well...I was in for an experience.  First, when someone ask to have their nails taken off that does not mean rip them off. The woman, Mary, used a nail tip to take off my acrylics...basically ripping off some of my nail bed in the process. I told her repeatedly that it hurt but she would only nod her head and smile. At some point she caused my finger to start bleeding because she ripped off so much nail and then proceeded to pour antiseptic on it which burned to no end.  Someone comes over to check on the situation but of course does not know anything about nails so she was no help. And there is no one else to finish this job. I had to demand that before we proceed, she needed to soak the rest of my nails. So after she finally gets the nails off she does a shitty job on the manicure. She basically filed my nails down to nothing, the fingernail that was bleeding still hurts, and the polish was not applied well.  I cannot speak for the another nail techs but I basically got suck with someone who did not know how to do her job.  All I got was a weak apology about my bleeding finger and pain that has last into the next day from her ripping off the acrylics.  I do not write reviews but I was so pissed off with the service that I receive that I needed to write this one.  Again each nail tech is different but an establish should check for consistency in technique and service. I will NEVER go to this establish again. And just know that I will tell everyone I know about my experience there.</td></tr><tr><td>4otTV9xEVu0G2mQUBjFF6Q</td><td>-1</td><td>Nothing is Consistant. Sales reps don't communicate with techs. Tech don't communicate with sales reps. The service is shotty. It's way too expensive for the lack of technology. Their new system looks like a toy. Not advance machine. The billing process isn't managed well so there are constant issues and when it's ads fault they won't fix it. I can go on and on and on. I would just say avoid it altogether.

In comparison to some, it's one of the pricier picks, but it's so good. When coffee is that satisfying, I don't mind paying a teensy bit more for it. Secondly, the mochas are really yum. This is always my grab n' go beverage from here.\n\nI should say that I never hang out at the shop. I like to take my coffee and stroll around Kensington or brew at home. Upon entering the place, I've never seen bodies strewn about as some have described. Just people hanging out (sitting in chairs!) inside or out, catching some sun and enjoying a coffee and passing no more judgement than the rock n republic wearing, coach toting \"other\" coffee-house crowds.</td></tr><tr><td>10WAHCOTn3XRXb05Y__EBA</td><td>-1</td><td>I use to work here about 5 years ago and now I am embarrassed to have said that.

I asked the server what the hell is going on.  He said that the people that own Planet Hollywood had bought the Macaroni Grill brand from Brinker International.

There were only three techs , neither that was close to being done with their clients. I had to wait 20 min and didn't have time for the mani. They were so unfriendly. The nail tech took this dirty looking buffer that was wrapped in an old paper towel. I asked if she had used it on someone else. She gave me an attitude and said \"what do you want? A brand new one?\" Of course I said yes! Horrible customer service and just a fair pedi. Lame massage. Place is dirty too.

Confused, I began to knock on the window showing her my ticket once again, and she put up her index finger at me as if to say \"one minute\" and drove away, never returning.  I called the company number and spoke to a supervisor named Tena who suggested I take a different means of transportation to the airport and assured me that I would be reimbursed for the inconvenience.  Two weeks later, and I'm still fighting with them on my full taxi fare reimbursement that they promised.  Save yourself the aggravation and go with a different shuttle company.

Started the meal with stale bread a 20 min wait for beverages. The olive oil was tasty but I'm assuming the guys in the back had nothing to do with that. Mind you it was 5pm on a Wednesday. When our server did bring drinks I mentioned this was our first time and we looked forward to some authentic pasta. He stared into my eyes, awkwardly, and said, \"Yep, were kind of the real deal\". I knew then we were in for it. The pizza was fine but the pappardelle with bolognese was umm.. Not amazing. It wasn't the pasta itself rather the sauce that turned me off. Bland, slightly tomatoey and vaguely creamy with a smattering of coarsely ground meat. Just not what I know Bolognese to be. In my world it's deep red and heavy on pancetta, ground veal or pork and beef with just enough tomato to make everything come together. They missed the target. Sorry guys. If you want a decent pizza give it a shot or just find a Grimaldi's, La Bocca or Isa's. Have I been harsh? Maybe, but I'm tired of these trendy spots telling me what the \"Real Deal\" is. Thanks but no thanks. Next time I want good pasta I'm staying home.</td></tr><tr><td>Svn8906ZU2dgd3YGdAfEAg</td><td>-1</td><td>Was looking to get a quick dinner and wanted to try it as it was relatively new to the neighbourhood. The place itself is small and has a few tables, comfortably fitting a few pairs and maybe 1 or 2 groups of 4. No full menu on the walls but they had stacks of printed ones to look through. \n\nI ordered 2 chicken dinners and a salad and paid. There was 1 other person there and they ordered as well. I expected the order to be maybe 5-10 minutes, it was only 2 entrees and most of the food should have been just reheat (meat). After a 15 minute wait, I asked how much long, was quickly told just a few more minutes and dismissed. \n\nThe cashiers/front staff seemed to care more about chatting and taking their time restocking. One of them asked the other if they just help the kitchen staff and the other said they weren't paid to do so.\n\nBoth I and the other customer ended up with our meals more than 25+ minutes later. The service, speed, and attitude of the staff was absolutely disappointing. To be fair, one customer that came in got their sandwich right away. In terms of food, my wife enjoyed their chicken (I thought it was average), and the rest was mediocre. \n\nConsidering the price we paid ($40+) I expected much more. I will not be returning and don't recommend Sofra unless you don't have any other choice in the area and are willing to wait / deal with any poor service.</td></tr><tr><td>RdfqyrGSgpQxOBfe_3p7Og</td><td>-1</td><td>Crappy experience on a Sunday night. What a waste of my cheat day. I don't know how they got so many good reviews. Drinks were watered down and frozen drinks were chunky. Food took fooooorever to get to us. I'd forgive them for that if the food was good. We got the pork chop which was overcooked, the salmon had a good crispy skin but was salty, the ahi tuna was salty, and the Ricky Ricardo sandwich just tasted like a mustard sandwich. The beers took so long to get to our table that they were lukewarm by the time that they got to us. The table next to us were so fed up with waiting that they left even after waiting such a long time to get to their table. They were probably understaffed.

We had already done a longer day trip to Tremlant, so we were looking for an option closer to Montreal for the 2nd morning.\n\nThe 4.8 mile hike we did to the scenic overlook was just a slight uphill, making it a casual and easy morning hike with a beautiful view at the top. Then just across the road is a nice beach where we were able to relax after. If you're up for it, there's a 13K hike option that actually ends at the beach and you can jump into the water after. The only down side to this park was in comparison to the untouched beauty of Tremblant we soaked in the day before, Oka seemed a bit more commercial and touched by man. However, its proximity to the city makes it an unbeatable option, especially if you're short on time and want to make sure to not miss the scenic Canadian beauty.

In anticipation (and of coming here before a couple months ago), I had everything in my email, and was going to forward it to their email to get it printed off. But instead, they made me go to the computer and swipe my card. It is .30 per minute, and .30 per page. After fumbling around I finally was able to log in to my account, and taking into account of the load time for the pages, I was on there for five minutes, then I somehow printed off 8 useless pages. So $5....\n\nSo I asked to reprint. They showed me to the computer again and I swiped my card. Which no one explained to me not to do. Because they had planned to make me keep the first charge and have this new one for free. Since I didn't know this I was a lot faster and got away with a $2 charge and 6 pages instead of 8. But they're still billing me the $5. \n\nOverall, it was a horrible experience and I had 7 minutes to get in and out of the grocery store. What could have taken 4 minutes at most turned into a 20 minute ordeal. If it was nicer paper stock then I would have let it slide, but it's see through, and crinkles to the touch easily.

With time and encouragement from Mr. Delgado he can now stand up for himself in a positive manner and no longer is bullied. He has gone from not being able to look people in the eye to competing and placing at nationals and worlds, and winning multiple state titles. My son who struggled to hold a pencil correctly has competed the last two years with a a bo staff in a way I never thought he would be successful. Mr. Delgado was able to see the whole child and work with him to overcome his challenges and be successful, he pushes him mentally and physically.

I went for a whole week thinking I was dying before I got in with a cytologist, who explained that what Lorraine thought she was reading as a stage of cancer was actually just how deep the tumor was.

I am aware that there is a learning curve to certain skills and that these are students who are practicing and need to be cut some slack and given grace, and I'm ok with that! Additionally, I have the most hair anyone in that salon has probably ever seen, and it's thick, and unbelievably kinky so I'm not coming in with the best canvas to work on. \n\nI asked for a Deep conditioning treatment with a blow dry. Simple enough, right? This student squirted conditioning treatment ALL OVER my head, and proceeded to massage it into my scalp!!! She sat me under the dryer for 20 minutes where I thought \"that's ok, she will probably shampoo one more time after she washes the treatment out.\" NOPE!!!!!!!! As she started to dry my hair, she noted it's heavy and thick and takes forever to dry. I must have requested at least 3 times to get blown out with a round brush. But, when she discovered it would take more than 10 minutes with a round brush she switched to a padle and said she would fix it later. Ok, fine. \n\nThe deeper into the service, the worse it got. As she as drying, I kept thinking, she's not getting it dry! Only to find out that it in fact was just grease and conditioner ALL OVER MY HEAD! Although she never went back and did the finishing touches with a round brush like I asked; the paddle brush she used did so a decent job.  \n\nWhen she motioned that I was done I pointed out that there were some parts that were still sopping wet, and also; why does my hair look like I haven't washed it this year? This lady proceeded to tell me it's my fault for 2 reasons: first, I didn't brush my hair (WHAT?!?!!) and secondly, because I was sweating. I was so offended.\n\nThe pictures alone will show you, this is not sweat. I have washed my hair 3 times since coming home and it's still a disaster. Over an hour in the shower trying to get this product OUT!!! \n\nWhat I am most appalled by is the lack of leadership or supervision. These pictures were taken no less than 10 minutes upon exiting the salon and I am flabbergasted that any instructor or teacher let me walk out looking like this.

Just like the other two restaurants in that complex, Stone & Vine, and Salt & Lime I think it's called, service is horrible and staff clearly has no direction from their leaders! Restaurant is in shambles and not to mention the fact that they've changed their menu countless times now - that tells me there's some serious work that needs to be done in back of the house as well! I don't think I'll be going back - already have been there three times now and clearly nothing seems to be getting better. In addition, I find that with management struggling to get this restaurant off the ground, maybe they should work on actually doing that and not standing around socializing and sitting at the bar - yes, management sitting at the bar.

Now while I get take out here a few times a year and absolutely love their curry, I can tell you that this one experience has put me off from ever eating here again. \n\nFirstly, after speaking to an employee for a table for 4 and asking for an approximate wait time we were forgotten.  I could forgive this as it was quite busy when we went. \n\nSecondly, it took quite some effort to flag down a waiter to order. We spoke to three waitresses before being served. Again, it was quite busy and the staff looked very frazzled, I could forgive this. \n\nLastly, while our appetizers and two main dishes came out very quickly, the remaining two main dishes for my mother and myself were forgotten.  We kept waiting and waiting until it had been half an hour since the other two members of our party received their main dishes. When we asked about it I found out that they had forgotten our order and asked us again what we ordered. We received no apology and I had to ask multiple times what happened. This I could not forgive. \n\nThe food my mother received had a smoky flavour and some of the vegetable were charred black and at the same time the vegetables were undercooked as if they half assed it for us to get our food quickly. After all the effort it took to even get the food we couldnt be bothered to tell them. \n\nAt the end of the meal I asked our waitress politely if we could speak to the manager. She said ok, went to the bar area and spoke to a man and came back to us saying she was the manager.  \n\nI can honestly say this experience has ruined this restaurant for me and my family. We can definely say we will never eat in here again. \n\n**in response to the owner:\nNo we did not finish all the food. I could not finish my meal because I had no appetite by the time it got to my table. I took it to go. And my mother did not finish her meal because of the smoky/burnt flavour and undercooked veggies. Her meal was given to us for free only after I spoke to the \"manager\" which was very nice.</td></tr><tr><td>WWXF2Wz1jeiAnb72KGOFxA</td><td>-1</td><td>My dog is an ADA recognized service animal and has traveled with me every time I've flown to/from my primary residence in Hawaii.

Sadly, this vet clinic is THE WORST I've experienced in the 10 years of owning my dog! I verified/confirmed (several times) the exact vet fees & services my dog would be receiving, both before making an appointment and when I arrived to the clinic at check-in. Upon checking-out, they charged me for an additional service that was not rendered, quoted or disclosed to me prior. They did this to me TWICE! When I brought it to their attention, two of the staff members became hostile and insulting.

No offer to remake it or compensate in any way. Too much garlic in the sauce because people that make bad pizza think that the way to make good pizza is to add lots of garlic in the sauce.

We completed our research in November and had decided to move our Home/Auto Insurance policies to another carrier because their rates were less than half of what I was already paying through StateFarm.  At that same time we decided to also take advantage of the lower interest rates so we refinanced with our same lender.  \n\nWhile working on our 2014 taxes we realized we had never been refunded by StateFarm for the unused insurance.  Shortly after that we received our annual Homeowners renewal notice from StateFarm for 2015-16.  I contacted my representative Craig Bachler at Jonathan Ritchie's StateFarm office to find out why my cancellation was not processed.  Craig said he just needed the new insurance carrier's Declarations page showing the policy initiation date in order for our policy to be backdated and a refund processed.  We immediately emailed the requested document and followed up with a phone call a week later to check status.   We were told these things can take time and we should just \"sit tight\".  We waited OVER TWO MONTHS with NO phone calls, emails or any other form of communication from Jonathan Ritchie's office.   So we, ONCE AGAIN, had to initiate contact for an update.  We emailed Craig then followed up with a phone call.  Spoke with the receptionist and was told Craig would \"be in touch\".  The following day Craig emailed us denying our refund.  He noted in his email that StateFarm's policy is to not refund customers when they leave them and switch to other insurance carriers.  He acknowledged in his email that we did contact him in November, but, he said it was only to advise him that we were refinancing and we didn't mention anything about canceling our policy.  That's not true.  When we contacted him we had already initiated a policy with another insurance carrier which began in November.  The reason we called was to cancel our policy, not to advise them of a refinance which would be meaningless to him since we had already moved to another insurance carrier.  What he said makes absolutely no sense at all.  We don't have to notify our insurance carrier that we have refinanced when we retain the same lender.  It's their word against ours and State Farm Corporate doesn't care to step in since we are no longer their customer.  \n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nBEWARE OF STATE FARM AND THE JONATHAN RITCHIE OFFICE!!!!  \n\nNO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR CANCELLATION REQUEST OVER THE PHONE PUT YOUR CANCELLATION IN WRITING.  THEIR WORD OVER THE PHONE MEANS NOTHING......\n\nEX-State Farm Customer</td></tr><tr><td>DI6ozxHJ02gvOhLuCJJ-zg</td><td>-1</td><td>You get zero (0)...

When I got the portfolio back it was bound on the wrong side, I had told the employee that it was not the way I wanted and he said it was completely my fault for printing it wrong. I tried to explain to him that I wanted a short bound instead of a long bound, but he continuously said that I printed it incorrectly. His co-worker intervened and understood what I wanted and told me that he will reprint everything so he could bind a new copy for me. I gave my USB and let him reprint a new copy, however, he printed it incorrectly and realized he had to reprint again. I was charged about $40 for all three copies including the two bound services and I wasted 2 hours for service that would take less than 10 mins.</td></tr><tr><td>pZ0yznxWXU8OY2uFHBcacw</td><td>-1</td><td>Richard has tinted numerous cars for me and there is never any issue.

Shaking got worse over next few days. Then it got really bad, even worse at speed. This was clearly a result of their work. Took car back in to have them take a look. Suddenly they warned me that my bushings were in terrible shape and needed to be replaced for $1400 dollars! Why didn't they notice this when they put the tires on? I smelled a rat, so I took it to another mechanic I now would trust with my life. They told me my bushings were just fine and that a bolt had been loosened which was causing all of my shaking problems. \n\nA bolt was loose that wasn't before. How did that happen? I can't prove that they loosened the bolt on purpose, but I absolutely would not doubt it with how dishonest they were about what was wrong. The amazing mechanic at the other shop tightened the bolt for FREE!!! and the problem was solved in about 5 minutes.\n\nSo we have two possibilities, either:\n\nA. Kelly Clark lied and wanted to scare me into paying an exorbitant amount for a totally unnecessary repair.\n\nor \n\nB.  Kelly Clark is so incompetent that they improperly put on my bolts, didn't notice it at all the first time, didn't notice it at all the second time even when I specifically mentioned a problem that would be caused by that, didn't notice at all that I (supposedly) desperately needed bushings, and then finally suggested a completely irrelevant repair that would not have even solved the bolt problem.

I have always eaten well, at decently nice places. This place was completely horrible from the start. We came to the place Friday to look at the menu because we have lived in Henderson now for 11years and have wanted to try the place since we moved here. The hostess was rude and has no customer service at all. We took the to go menu and decided to eat at jalisco's. Tonight (Saturday) we decided to buy the groupon and proceeded to our reservation at 7:30. We arrive and this time no one is at the hostesses stand. The first person we see is the manager. No greeting from this guy period. He just sticks his finger up like one minute. Then comes the same rude hostess. She says how many? She then says two? I say yes. She says are you Bobby? I say yes. She says you no you have two reservations?  I say no. She says yes you did and I just deleted one. I'm thinking OK great. A hello, welcome, heck anything is better than telling me what she thinks I Might have done wrong. We get to the table and the waiter approaches us and ask's would you like something to drink. I say coke, he says we only have Pepsi. I said what else do you have. He ignores me and takes my wife's order. Then he looks at me and stares, I don't say a word. After about 25 seconds he says and for you? I again repeat what else do you have? He starts to name things,and I stop him and say I would like the tea. He leaves, comes back and says what would you like to eat. My wife ask if he has any specials? He rattles them off. He was actually good at this. My wife orders chicken parmesan, and I ask about the lasagna. I say how is it made. He stumbles over some words that I don't understand. Then he looks at me with a deer in the head lights look and says what do you mean how is it made almost in a challenging way. I say well is it vegetable lasagna and before I can finish he says it's meat sauce. I say OK but how is the lasagna actually made he cuts me off and says it's meat. I say OK. I'll take the lasagna. They bring my wife's food and it looks OK. Then they bring mine and I don't say a word. This its suppose to be fine dining? They bring me a boat. (A boat is a ceramic dish that is oblong not very big at all, and not deep at all.) I take a bite of this and there is no sauce at all. I was expecting a regular plate like everyone else. The taste was terrible. It taste like something I eat at someone else's house whose wife don't cook so well. The funny thing is he cuts me off and says its meat sauce. I had the guy that brings you the drinks get me some sauce. The sauce was actually good and it made the food stomachable. The manager visited this one table in front of us and hung out there almost half the time we were there. He never visited our table once. This place is terrible with customer service and food.

I was pleased with the result.  I also enjoyed the setting for doing a little writing and conversating.  \n\nThe second time I grabbed a cappucino to go. I do hate to drink my coffee out of a paper cup, but time was short and I thought at least it will be a well crafted beverage.  Wrong!  In fact it was undrinkable.  Really really dissapointing considering I was already on a shuttle Hamilton by the time I realized what a disaster this drink was.  \n\nCut to six months later I decide to give it another shot, thinking maybe they accidentally ran manure through the portafilter instead of espresso.  I figure from the reviews this place gets they must have got their shit together.  So on this third visit I met my wife who had about 45 mins off in the middle of her work day.  We wanted a quality alternative to the big chain coffee shops that litter this area.  \n\nThe layout of the cafe had been completely re-arranged.  It is now more open, but has lost some of it's cozy factor.  The service was uber-slow.  We ordered a cappuccino, tea and cookie.  It took ten to fifteen minutes for the drinks to come.  It wasn't busy.  There is no reason that it should have taken this long, resulting in us having to gulp it down in order to get my wife back to work on time.  The two staff on hand look like they wanted to be anywhere else.\n\nThe cappuccino was at least drinkable, but far from good.  It tasted as though they weren't pulling the espresso hot enough, or under extracting the shot.  I have to give these guys extra shit, because they have a Synesso espresso machine which has the most fine tuned controls you can get for pulling shots.  If you are going to spend twenty grand on an epresso machine make sure you can make a better cappuccino than I can make at home with a Moka Pot and stale coffee beans.  In addition the milk was poorly frothed.  No latte art and uneven foam.

At first I wasn't a huge fan, but later on I developed a  craving for it.  So I ordered it again via carryout.  We also ordered a flounder dinner with a salad and baked potato.  The cheddar biscuits were also included.  I tore into the cheddar biscuits as I was starving.  They were okay.  Though they are never as good as they are in the restaurant as they cool on the car ride home.  Then I opened the pizza.  I was initially happy to see it appeared to be crunchier than the last one I ordered.  I like my pizza on the crunchier side.  Then I tasted it and realized it had been sitting out and probably reheated, thus creating a crunchier appearance.  The baked potato with the flounder dinner was small and shriveled.  It also appeared to have been reheated.  \nUpon calling to let them know, the hostess did apologize and told us we could get a refund.  When we returned the food, the manager didn't apologize and merely gave us a refund.   We might've been willing to try it again if we'd been offered an apology from the manager.  We won't be returning.</td></tr><tr><td>xsawU-qtEWISO9hpkkepvQ</td><td>-1</td><td>We dined in for lunch today.  The server, Brett, must've determined that since we ordered so little (margherita flat bread and soup and salad) that we weren't really worth his time.  He alternated between looking like he'd forgotten something and spending time stopping by other tables before he would stop by ours after we caught his eye.  So it was difficult to tell if he was new or just a bad server.  He never really apologized or explained that he forgot our bread or why it took a long time to come out.  When he did come to the table he seemed to be in a hurry and didn't have the time to spend with us.  The food was actually pretty good.  But the experience was spoiled by the bad service.  We ordered so little because we were saving room for dessert.  Which we did order, but he was in such a hurry we had to stop him to tell him that we wanted it.  Then he didn't bring it out correctly.  We ordered cheesecake with just fresh strawberries, it came out with the strawberry sauce on top of the strawberries.  I would normally excuse that kind of error. But he was in such a hurry I don't think he heard me correctly.  But since we doubted he would be coming back anytime soon, we just ate it quickly and paid the bill.  \nA lot of the food the other tables were receiving looked really good.  But not so good that we will be trying it anytime soon.  Maybe we'll try another one in another area.</td></tr><tr><td>VJZch5vrlEOnhQI6hKH_lQ</td><td>-1</td><td>We have have done this sort of thing before and really enjoyed it .

What they don't tell you though- is that most the courses are very very small and it's all vegan. Yes you right that right - 100% vegan. Why they are not totally up front about this I don't know ... probably because they figure it would put people off.\nThe food was bland, boring and not worth even half what we paid.

The bartender told us to stand near the window to be seated, yes the bartender told us that. It was  the slowest service I have ever encountered.  10 mins to be seated, 10 mins for a cup of water, another 10 mins for the waiter to take our orders. Ordered hot bread, crab cake, and wine. After we finished the appetizer, we waited for the waiter for a while and I personally stop him and tell him that we are ready to order our dinner . \"I will be right back after I put back these plates\" he got back to us after taking desert order from the table next to us, send check to another table, deliver food to another, take a sip of water. I was  boiling at this moment. Finally, he comes by and my wife told him we need the check, we are tired of waiting. His response is \"ok\".\n\nI have never spent 1 and half hour having appetizers, they just don't care. If you plan to come here, make sure you have patience and really enjoy the view.</td></tr><tr><td>iyfMtg4-EjiHS5Ysfi8t3Q</td><td>-1</td><td>I was thoroughly unimpressed by this place. It is not hard to mess up a burger, but they managed to do it. The server lacked any education about the menu,and it took forever to get drinks. We never even got the orange juice we asked multiple people for to go with the bottles of champagne. When asked if medium rare was a true medium rare, the server (with arrogance) said that the chef was a professional so of course it was a true medium rare. Everyone in my group ordered a burger medium or medium rare. Needless to say, every burger came out well done. All of us were so hungry that we are them. One of my friends refused and sent it back. The server and manager came back with her new burger and watched while she cut it in half. To our surprise, it was still cooked well done. We ended up getting a lot of our meal comped, but I wouldn't go back. You can find a better burger and service in Vegas.</td></tr><tr><td>QgQYVaF6LJNArdtu6sS5Xg</td><td>-1</td><td>I used to love this place and their meatball pizza.

I've only ever seen the same 2 employees there no matter what time or day of the week I've been. They raised their price for a shawarma wrap by a whole dollar which isn't very good value for what you get (6.20 compared to Osmows which is 5 dollars exactly and Osmows wraps are gigantic). They have a \"Spicy Mashed Potato Samosa\" which is divine. I've only ever ordered samosas or chicken in a wrap here. Samosa is 5/5 shawarma wrap 4/5. Not much variety for what you can put inside but sometimes less is better. I usually order shawarma with just chicken and sauces with no vegetables anyway wherever I go</td></tr><tr><td>KQ80RZF4WQL2Ix1qDkvuqQ</td><td>-1</td><td>It's the little things I like about FatBurger... you know how most fast food places give you what - like, one packet of ketchup, maybe two - then give you that gluttonous pig look if you ask for more? Well, there's a bucket on the counter at FatBurger. Take all you want. Nice. And there are napkin dispensers on every table. Nothing like making a mess and having to first get up and walk across the room to be able to clean it up.\n\nI avoided FatBurger for years because, well, it's called FatBurger. Didn't figure they'd serve anything besides meat. Most burger places don't. But ever since a friend of mine introduced me to their veggie burger a while back - a seriously thick Boca patty on a whole wheat bun - I now stop by once a month or so to get my veggie burger fix. Coming in around nine bucks for a meal deal with fries and a drink it's definitely a little pricy for fast food, but I have to admit - it is that much much better. Burgers are loaded up with fresh toppings, and the fries are delicious - thick & crisp (and generous portions). Never tried a shake, but I heard they're good.</td></tr><tr><td>TX9f8Y1yorDnpe9x8ykO4w</td><td>-1</td><td>I was so proud of myself for finally getting around to cashing in the $5 coupon I received for running the 10K Turkey Trot last Thanksgiving, which Mi Amigo's sponsors, and I gotta tell ya, I really, really wish I hadn't.

Otherwise, same as every other theater in town.\n\nSaw Space Monkeys with my lil bro this afternoon, which was amusing - a little fast & loose with the science for my taste, but in its defense it was an animated picture about monkeys in space - but once again, nobody there.

Granted it was Space Chimps, but even out in the lobby, hardly anybody around.\n\nOne note about the parking garage (besides don't forget to get your ticket validated): The signs on the wall with the big '5' on them - that's the speed limit, not the floor number. One night me and my friend walked around forever looking for the car because when we pulled up I said, \"We're on 5, don't forget it.\" Yes, I'm admitting it, in front of everyone. It was my fault.

That was just the beginning, I had purchased a new IPhone7 two days earlier and the home key was sticking so I needed to exchange. They said their diagnostic didn't show a problem so they could not help me, I needed to go to Apple for any exchange.

This went on for some time when she finally said she would check to see if he would be \"willing\" to talk with me. After less than a minute she returned to say he was at lunch and would be gone for an hour. I told her I would wait- after 5 minutes he magically appeared from the back office and was very upset that I was \"bothering\" him and I quickly realized that a team is just a good (or in this case bad as their leader). His lack of professionalism and argumentative demeanor far exceeded hers! In the end, he said that \"everyone\" is complaining about the iPhone 7 home key and that is why he hasn't bought one yet. He further confirmed there was nothing he could do (or would do) and when I said but I just bought this phone 2 days ago he shrugged his shoulders and said \"oh well\" as he walked away. Wow.

I was captive with my feet in the bowl and had to sit there for another 20 minutes.  Oh, did I mention this was on MY BIRTHDAY??  Hubbie had dropped me off as a surprise (which made it worse).  I refuse to be treated that way and I will never go back.</td></tr><tr><td>fmf0Rw_Z8iQypMp_CRjWWw</td><td>-1</td><td>No Bueno. \n\nWe tried this location as it is closer to our house. We walked in at 8:30 and the girl at the counter immediately said \"we close in 30 minutes!\".  I told her, \"yes, that's why we are here at 8:30\".  \n\nWe ordered two tortilla soups, a flying saucer and chips and salsa.  The salsa was served in the smallest condiment plastic to go cups possible. Although you order at the counter, I would never expect at a restaurant that you have the options to \"dine in\", to be served tortilla soup in a styrophome cup!!!!!!  My daughter ordered a flying saucer and she was served on a plate. This really bothered me.   \n\nFood was ok, but I can't handle feeling like I'm picnicking when we are dining out. We'll opt for Gecko Grill or the original Tia Rosas next time. I would MAYBE go back for take out only.</td></tr><tr><td>2ffHBrHzFnPE5cRQaDBiDw</td><td>-1</td><td>WORST MCDONALDS EVER! \n\n90% of the time they get your order wrong and sometimes at night they only accept cash... This place is poorly ran by a very rude manager who can't even get an order right when he takes it. He also wouldn't take the time to fix it. Do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere!</td></tr><tr><td>ralASprb6fJaCj0mZKoOsA</td><td>-1</td><td>When to Los Taquitos looking for shrimp tacos.  Not spectacular.  Beans okay and breakfast burrito good but the help was not.  It was very cold inside as if they decided not to turn on the heat or they do not have heat.

We probably will never go back.</td></tr><tr><td>M2s3hoSqX3eLt6EC7csuVQ</td><td>-1</td><td>I've been going here since June/12 and it is a Vietnamese Lady that owns and operates this business.

While we were running a bit late we arrived (shoes on, ready to play) at 6:40 for a 6:52 tee time. When we arrived the guys at the pro shop acted like we had committed a horrible crime. In a very stern voice one said \"YOU ARE LATE AND THE OTHER TWO IN YOU GROUP HAVE ALREADY TEED OFF\"...hummm 12 minutes early. We rushed and actually teed off at 6:44 (8 minutes before our actual tee time). We were told we needed to catch the other two we were paired with so we played speed golf for the first two holes.\n\nWe continued to play at a reasonable pace (played 10 holes in one hour and 45 minutes); however, there was a three some behind us who was constantly hitting into us...I nearly got hit by a ball. The ranger came to our party on hole 11 and asked us to speed it up or let the other party play through. We let them play through but I found them and the ranger to be very rude. We ended up finishing our round in less than 3.5 hours. Not sure if this customary for this course but we felt we were playing at a reasonable pace\n\nFinally, the course has a very blah layout, could use a little TLC and was not very challenging.</td></tr><tr><td>ifRgKTwP9txAfH07kFTAzA</td><td>-1</td><td>The food was very good. Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal.\n\nThe service was something less than expected. We were told there would be a wait and understood that was to be expected. A very nice gentleman took a cell phone number to text when the table would be ready. This is a great system. In less than 15 minutes we were texted for seating. When we walked over to get our table, the hostess looked to me and said \"they can wait\" in a very unpleasant voice. The gentleman said \"No\" and took us to our table. Thanks for standing up to that bully of a Hostess!!!\n\nOur service was extraordinarily poor! It took about 20 minutes before we got out drinks except one persons in our group never his drink. I had to go to the bar after about 45 minutes to get it myself. The server, who was standing there doing nothing said \"the bartender got slammed and never got around to your drink\". Why didn't she do something about is? Was she going to do anything about it? It was only a beer. I asked him for it and he took less than 10 seconds to grab, untwist the cap and hand it to me...I wondered of the Hostess had anything to do with our poor service?\n\nIt's unfortunate to have pretty good food with employees who are killing the business.</td></tr><tr><td>vs57chGXNTq7MDcZ8nPyHQ</td><td>-1</td><td>How do you give a half of a star?  This place is not good.  I ordered a pizza for 2 for me and my wife.  My wife has a gluten allergy so we ordered the Gluten free pizza.  It tasted horrible.  I paid $14 for a personal size pizza that was maybe 8 inches in diameter.  It wouldn't feed me let alone the both of us.  Ridiculously overpriced for what you are getting.  You could get a better pizza at QT honestly.  We now order online from MOD Pizza that is about a half mile from this place.  All the toppings you want and the price of the pizza stays the same.  $7.97 for an 11 inch pizza.  No folks, I'm not lying.  Check it out.</td></tr><tr><td>2D7XTlT3tDElk4HA_cswyA</td><td>-1</td><td>You should be allowed to give a half a star or no star.  I ordered flowers for my wife's birthday.  What a complete disappointment. Let me start by saying they didn't have sunflowers in stock at the time of my call (not a major issue).  (Strike 1)  $85 for a medium arrangement.  It was medium in size, but after 2 days half of the flowers were dead or drooping. (Strike 2)  They were in her office on the desk at 65 degree temperature so they shouldn't wilt and wither away like they did.  I call to complain 12 minutes before they are due to close today and they don't answer the phone. (Strike 3)   I cannot understand how businesses like this (you know them, the one's that exude little to no professionalism) are able to stay in business.  I will never use their services again.</td></tr><tr><td>Pddm1vp7S69sFoEpcK_OZg</td><td>-1</td><td>By far some of the worst sushi I've had.

No one to be seen, not a single employee. Went to the yogurt and the grates were absolutely filthy. I couldn't even test any of the flavors because we couldn't get sample cups (no employee to be found still). My wife and daughter already knew what they wanted so they already got there yogurt but the machines leaked all over them. Hands sticky, anger rising & then finally!!! An employee as arrived. A kid from the back came out and he gave me a few sample cups and then disappeared again. I test a couple and give up and just go for chocolate. My wife gets to the topping and looks at me and says she wants to leave. My daughter can't see past the counter (thank god). The sight we see is rotten fruit and missing toppings. So we set down our cups and leave. Off to Yogurtland!</td></tr><tr><td>kB-eDXrPJ_dm7DxOomq42w</td><td>-1</td><td>So in todays day in age Yelp has created some of the worst customers in the world & as much as i would love to say everyones review can be trusted, that would be a lie. I ignored all the negative comments and went into the eastern store. As i walked up to the store i was greeted by the young men in the front with a smiling face, as i walked through the door the young cashiers in the front then greeted me! I went in looking for a chemical to kill worms on my grapes. Before i even reached the first aisle a young man named Tristan asked if i needed help. In all honesty he seemed too young to have enough knowledge to help me with my questions so i told him no. After 10 minutes of looking through the products and not finding what i wanted he found his way back to me and asked again if i was doing alright. I gave in and let him know my problem & was completely shocked when he assured me it was a easy fix and showed me to a organic worm killer. Not only did he show me it, he told me the active ingredients without even reading the bottle! He then told me how it killed the worms and still was safe on edibles. I was 100% pleased with my service and understand what they mean by saying \"do not judge a book by it's cover\".</td></tr><tr><td>fwCcEYSenoKI9apdXj2LJA</td><td>-1</td><td>Horrible!  I spit out three different things.  Shrimp in fried rice was stinky.  Fried Rice itself was not at all tasty.  Soy sauce in a sticky, nasty decanter that hadn't been washed in ages.  Egg Roll was inedible, besides also being cold.  Cashews in Cashew Chicken were stale and nasty.  Not much meat in Cashew Chicken.  Veggies in cashew chicken were not just crisp, they were totally uncooked.  The lunch buffet looked horrible.  \n\nThe woman taking the orders was nice and I debated whether to write this review because I don't want to harm her business.  But, like one other reviewer, I am concerned that I will be sick after eating there.  Also, I had myself psyched for some fried rice.  In both the public interest and my great disappointment, I decided to go ahead and write.  I should read Yelp reviews more often BEFORE I go out!</td></tr><tr><td>xps0RlTKBlJ65N3MmXiciA</td><td>-1</td><td>Bank of America never has enough tellers working. At this location or any other location in the area, and I've tried them all. If you actually have to ever go in the branch, which I do, this is not the bank for you. They normally have 1, maybe 2 tellers working, a line of 5-10 customers, and a wait of 15-20 minutes. It's like that 80% of the time, any time of the day. Some times you get lucky, mostly you don't. I went yesterday and their system was down. Ok, fine, I'll go back tomorrow ... and today there were 9 people in line. Ok, so I guess I'll try some other time, because I don't have time or patience to wait. It's like that most of the time. Just a constant aggravation. I was standing in line a month ago and another customer behind me started yelling at the tellers, literally yelling at them from the back of the line to get more people working, because there were 10 people in line, he was like 9th, and the line was crawling forward. Then they'll tell you all about the non-teller services they offer, but every other bank offers those services, too, and every other bank that I've been to also has enough tellers. I've come to loathe this bank, and after I'm done with this review, I'm off to open an account with a different bank.</td></tr><tr><td>toqKRogdEuA-p-Gr9TqtKg</td><td>-1</td><td>A menu and brand that poorly rips off Jack Astor's.

That being said, They are working with what they have in this small space, and it is all about the food. The menu is creative, offering a twist on some familiar sushi as well as things I've never seen before. While not the best I've ever had, this is the best Sushi in the Cleveland area to date. My favorites were the spicy scallop and E.L.S. roll.</td></tr><tr><td>q5urDqJOhvLqZ_4p6hA81Q</td><td>-1</td><td>WARNING!!!

I understand I was at fault for leaving my items behind, but staff could have some integrity in what they do. Not to mention the claims department has failed NUMEROUS times to return my phone calls or even have the courtesy to follow up. Obviously they can care less!

And then before preparing my sandwich I had to ask him to change his gloves for sanitary purposes since he had been using the same gloves to eat his food. He was offended by my request and he complained and tole me, \"they don't have any large size gloves, and it's hard for him to wear medium size gloves.\" Finally after he changed gloves and made my sandwich I told him to make my order \"to go\" and instead he charged me as \"dine in\" which is extra money with tax verse getting it \"to go.\" I'm never coming back to this store again! I was very I unsatisfied with the cleanliness of this store even the spinach on my Sandwich was old looking. Wow</td></tr><tr><td>QzSVJq_bHsMVJW_3YTyR7g</td><td>-1</td><td>The hotel room had a weird set-up, lots of wasted space and not a very good working area for my laptop.  The bed was VERY comfy.  The bathroom seemed to have fairly new fixtures.  The  tub was quite deep, but a bit narrow. The toilet seems to be in an odd place, right in front of the counter, but that does give you the benefit of additional counter space/  There is no valet ... and I almost never use one.  But I arrived during a large rainstrom and it seemed the garage was quite far.   It probably wasn't, but it sure seems that way when you are wet and cold.  My biggest complaint is the curtains, the middle portion is sheer and there was lots of light coming into the room when I was trying to sleep.  The door was incredibly difficult to open and I kept thinking the door was mis-programmed.  Free WiFi.\n\nBreakfast buffet is $17 and doesn't have a very extensive selection.  Chik-Fil-A is walking distance if you need a better option.   The restaurant stops serving food at 11 pm, no room service either after that hour either.</td></tr><tr><td>T-rYHjQd6wSsXlD_mfpxoQ</td><td>-1</td><td>BÃ¤sta showen jag har upplevt!

Don't get me wrong, me and my lil bro had a blast, me trying not to check out the parade of cute little goth princesses that were obviously too young for me to be checking out, him undergoing the early stages of Jedi training.. he received his official Padawan Learner status, btw.

Problem was, I didn't know exactly what I was looking for... I wanted something simple, but not too simple; something modern, but with a retro twist; something cool, but without looking like it's trying to be cool... Not too much to ask, is it? Not at Z Gallerie, where I found exactly what I was looking for - at what I consider very reasonable prices ($600 for the bed, $300 per nightstand). In addition to the furniture in the store, which in addition to furniture included lamps & artwork, we were shown their catalog, which contained an even larger selection. After not finding anything I liked anywhere else, I found myself now having to choose between several different bedroom sets.\n\nService at the time of purchase was pleasant and helpful. Once I made my selection, I waited patiently while the cashier called the warehouse to find out if the items were in stock or needed to be special ordered (longer delivery time). I was informed that my items were in stock and would be delivered within 2 weeks. Sadly, this did not happen. In fact, nothing happened. I never heard from them again. When I called them I was informed that my items had to be special ordered, and would not arrive for 3-4 weeks. I was assured I would receive a phone call from the delivery company within that timeframe. 4 weeks later, I called back to find out what was going on. I was told a manager would call me back. I left three additional messages over the next three weeks (each time providing my phone number), before finally speaking with a manager, who informed me that my furniture had arrived the week before. The problem? She said they had wrong phone number on file. If I hadn't provided my phone number 4 times, this could have been a valid excuse. But I did. Each time.\n\nMy furniture finally arrived this afternoon (8 weeks later), and while I love my new bedroom set, the customer service experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. \n\n4 stars for their furniture, 2 stars for their service.</td></tr><tr><td>vxgtaMFm9sEZ5rCACck7ww</td><td>-1</td><td>With the new black bean burger I had for dinner tonight - which is only 5 bucks for the entire month of January - Fez now has it all. It's not perfect, but it's damn good. I'm torn on the goat cheese - probably not my first pick to go with the black bean patty - but I do so love goat cheese that I'll forgive them. And I think they could do without the radishes. I don't know, just never thought they were good sandwich toppings. Also, the patty lacks a little in consistency, kind of gets crushed and you lose bits and pieces here and there with each bite. But it's quite tasty, so again, I'll forgive them. Someone said it was spicy, but I didn't think so. Will I order it again? That's the real question. And the answer is Hells yeah. Thanks Fez for thinking of us vegetarians and quasi-vegetarians that dig a good veggie burger. \n\nOh, and apparently they've got a few drink specials that are dependent on ordering the black bean burger, how cool is that?

And she'll eat anything. One time she ate a whole tube of Neosporin. Neosporin! What a freak. Love the pasta salad, but can't stand the potato salad. I keep going back, I just get the same thing every time. Almost took off another star because one time some chicken somehow ended up in my grilled feta sandwich (I don't eat chicken), which I didn't discover until I was chewing. Yuck!. Took me a long time to forgive, but I finally did. Haven't forgotten, though - I still peek inside before taking each bite.</td></tr><tr><td>0aa_l8NK2HFmRsG6ppnXeQ</td><td>-1</td><td>4 stars for what it is - cheap pizza.

The line moves pretty fast, even in the middle of the lunch rush, and there's a pretty good selection. For vegetarians, there are usually at least 3 or 4 veggie options other than just plain cheese - but not right when they open at eleven.\n\nEating inside can be fine or annoying depending what they're playing on the TV, which varies quite a bit, anything from Spike TV's MXC (hilarious) to Barney (extremely disturbing - seriously, have you ever sat and watched one of these shows?

The food: I've sampled various veggie and seafood options, and they've all been equally delicious. Since I've never been inside for more than a few minutes, I can't really vouch for the atmosphere or the service, but I stand by the food.

So despite all my rage, I was - come on, you know the line - trapped like a rat in a cage. What - too 90s for you? Come on, Pumpkins rocked, admit it.\n\nAnyway, so first I stood there in the waiting room, me and the other three people waiting for their cars. There was nobody behind the register.\nI asked them, \"Is there somebody working?\"\n\"Define working,\" one of them said. The others laughed.\n\nWhen the clerk finally showed up ten minutes later, he came in and started messing with the register, which I was standing in front of. \"Hello,\" I said. \"Wait,\" he said. I told him I just wanted a gift card. He nodded. One of the mechanics came in. Somebody's car was done. He called the guy, the guy came over.\n\nHere's their exchange:\nclerk: Your car's ready.\ncustomer: Did you rotate the tires?\nclerk: Yes. I mean no. (looks at paperwork) I don't know. (goes outside, talks to mechanic, comes back in). No. Do you want them rotated?\ncustomer: Yes.\nclerk: (sighs, waves customer away like he's swatting a fly)\ncustomer: I'll go ahead and pay for it, you know, since I'm standing here.\nclerk: oh, uh, I don't know if I can... (goes outside, talks to mechanic, comes back inside) Okay.\ncustomer: They're pulling my car out.\nclerk: What?\ncustomer: They're pulling my car out. I don't think they're not going to rotate the tires.\nclerk: do you still want the tires rotated?\ncustomer: No.\nclerk: (rings him up for oil change, no tire rotation)\n\nMy turn.\nme: \"I'd like a gift card.\"\nclerk: \"How much?\"\nme: (tell him amount) \nclerk: (stares at register for 5 minutes, every once in a while glancing over at piece of paper taped to wall)\nme: Everything okay?\nclerk: (goes outside, talks to mechanic, comes back inside with mechanic. Together they stare at register for another 5 minutes, then mechanic goes back outside, talks to another mechanic, comes back inside)\nmechanic: You want a gift card?\nme: Yes.\nmechanic: How much?\nme: (tell him amount)\nmechanic: (goes back outside, talks to another mechanic, comes back inside, stares at register, reads piece of paper, re-reads piece of paper, stares at register...)\nFinally they figure it out - he's got to swipe the gift card. Of course his hands are covered with grease. He hands me the card, covered in grease. Nice.

Hung out for a couple hours there this afternoon with my lil bro and man, we had a blast. Price-wise you can't beat the 2 hour unlimited play for $15 we hit. Don't think that's available all the time, but it was today. Score.  Service was actually really good too - what kind of service do you really need at an arcade? Well, not having been in one quite like this, it was kind of nice to have someone patiently explain the swipe card system (no pockets full of quarters anymore), not to mention the layout of the place (which is huge - two floors!). \n\nThe selection's incredible - everything from your typical racing games, shooting games and fighting games to basketball and skee ball and air hockey - there's even stuff I've never seen before, like a Karoake booth and jumping games (?) and roller coaster simulators. And as one reviewer mentioned, there are several that even require a seatbelt. A seatbelt. Sweet.</td></tr><tr><td>c_TEEJA3jMOloxohyDNlPg</td><td>-1</td><td>This Costco is the worst. The staff at the gas station have been downright rude to me on 2 occasions & the hours are really inconvenient. Closed Sundays and at 4pm on Saturdays? Most people only have time to bulk shop on weekends, even at a business center.  Plus the extra step of waiting in line AGAIN to show your receipt before walking out the door is insulting & a waste of my time.  The door is within an easy glance of check-out.

I asked it to be remade and again they added sugar. I don't understand...aren't smoothies supposed to be healthy? As I was sitting at the tables outside, some of their staff came out and sat at the next table smoking cigarettes.

My guess is that they hold reservations for \"VIPs\" because no restaurant has a two month wait list in Cleveland Ohio. No restaurant is worth that! We will not be going.

WARNING!\n\nBe EXTREMELY careful when you order here especially if you're taking it to go.  They will intentionally leave out certain items (egg rolls, fortune cookies, and such) and by the time you get home, it's too late (at least that's what they hope).  This has happened to me 3 times in a span of a month and every single time, it's been a to go order.  When we eat in, it's fine, every time.  Another thing to ABSOLUTELY look out for is the order accuracy.  I swear to you, over 80% of my orders have been wrong which is mind boggling! You will also notice people checking their orders before they walk out because everyone has been a victim of a wrong order or missing items which appears to be the norm.  Besides these shady business practices, the orange chicken is the only thing I eat here and that's OK when they actually make it right, which happens rarely.  Most of the times it's very mushy and soggy even when you're eating in so you need to MAKE SURE they fully cook it unless you want to eat mushy, moist breaded chicken.  Aside from the orange chicken, everything else I tried sucked.  I'm officially over orange chicken so I won't be going back to this restaurant ever again.  \n\nFinally, if your order is wrong, they WILL FIRST BLAME YOU and try to send you off but DO NOT CAVE IN!</td></tr><tr><td>ASvFKBto1ObcMTUYbQhXvg</td><td>-1</td><td>I was a little apprehensive about purchasing a meat package.

The reason for the delay is a maintenance issue (unexplained).\n\n(additional added later)\n\nTo make a long story short, we pushed back from the gate over 5-1/2 hours late only to sit at the pushed back position on the ramp for 10 minutes or more ( probably more, but I don't like to exaggerate) with no explanation from the cockpit. Then it got strange. One of the pilots came on the intercom to say that when the airplane was pushed back they got an annunciator light in the cockpit telling them something was wrong. Then he went on to say that they were doing some paperwork to set things right and we'd be off shortly. I'm a retired jet captain and I've never heard of paperwork fixing an airplane.

If you have anything like a phone or a wallet you want to keep safe the lockers are $40, felt a little steep. (it's only $10 at the encore pool). \n\nAll that aside... my friend slipped coming out of the pool and busted his face open (yes, he was drunk, but who isn't?) I told the security guard and they took him away and didn't let me come with. I tried to explain that he's extremely drunk and I'll need to be around to take him back to the room afterwards. They said the would come get me afterwards (which was fine). 20 minutes later they came and said that I should get my stuff, because he left! \n\nThey basically pushed him out to the street with a concussion and while being extremely drunk. It took us 45 minutes just to find him, because he couldn't even describe where he was, luckily he had his phone and enough sense to call us/answer calls.\n\nIn the end they didn't even stitch him up.

A second budtender walked up and I could already see what she was going to try to do.  My budtender told her I was next before leaving to handle another customer. The second budtender said \"oh I know\" and then waited until my budtender left and then jumped her customer ahead of everyone else in line.   The cashier not only did nothing about it but proceeded to ring up a total of THEEE more people skipping me even after she was told I was next.

I judge Persian restaurants by their most basic food - koobideh and barg. If your koobideh is not absolutely perfect, you are not a good Persian restaurant. Quite simple.\n\nZaffron is a westernized Persian place...blending authentic Iranian food with regular Italian dishes, thus ending up with a pretty extensive menu. But that's pretty much it. The barg (veal kabobs) wasn't as succulent as they should be, and the koobideh was a tad bland. The only thing that saved the place was the saffron rice, which quite easily was the best I have had.\n\nWhat put me off the most was my cocktail. I ordered a Mojito, and it arrived midway into my dinner. (took them 30 minutes to get a mojito!!). For its price, it was no where close to being a decent drink.\n\nThe waiters are friendly, and ours even explained the history of koobidehs, which was quite interesting. The patio seating is good for those cool summer evenings. Overall, the place is worth a visit if you are new to Persian food and don't mind driving across all the other inexpensive(but shady) restaurants present in that region.\n\nThe only reason I'll go back to this place is to try the ghormeh sabzi (another basic persian food), so that I can add or remove another star from the review!</td></tr><tr><td>wx5_-FDdEYoyQsLbDA1AGw</td><td>-1</td><td>Eliot's looks like a regular, tiny, dusty used book store from the outside, and unless you walk in, you won't realize what you are missing out on. This place is 3 floors high, and every single inch is packed with books.\n\nI was asked to leave my back pack at the counter, which is quite fair. Unlike some other reviewers, I found the old gentleman at the counter quite pleasant. (he might be someone else). \n\nThe place, although stocked with more books than you would expect at a used books store, is very well organized. Each section is neatly labeled, and I found browsing more convenient here as compared to a regular Chapters or Indigo. The sci fi and fantasy section contained almost all the books i was looking for. Although the space between book shelves is tight, you can still find a cozy corner for yourself to sit and go through books for hours. \n\nThey have a pretty decent history section, with some really interesting books. I was also impressed by selection of books on religion and philosophy. For those into new age and occult stuff, they have a larger collection of books than I have seen at any other used books store. The upper floor has a neat collection of books on acting, theatre, cocktail mixing and Canadian Lit.  I was particularly taken by the music section, and ended up buying a few books on the history of rock and jazz.\n\nThe prices seem fair, although I would have loved this place more if they hadn't blackened most of the prices on the spine of the books with a sharpie. \n\nI am going to be a regular visitor at Eliot's, just to enjoy those lazy afternoons browsing for books in a lovely, vintage library atmosphere.</td></tr><tr><td>KD7EGmD-y11oe3eC1nFonw</td><td>-1</td><td>Gasa is a typical, tiny, hole in the wall Sri Lankan take out restaurant. They seem to have a huge fan base, as when we entered, the place had a long queue.\n\nThe menu is quite simple, with regular Tamil fare like kothhu roti, vadas, bondas, mutton rolls, fish buns and tandoori chicken.\n\nWe tried the mutton rotis, as they appeared baked, not fried. The thing was just stuffed with potatoes, and I couldn't find any mutton at all. Maybe we got the wrong orders, or those things were just misnamed. The deep fried mutton rolls also lacked meat. The Tandoor chicken was loaded with chillies, and that's something i have never experienced while having tandoor at Indian restaurants.\n\nMy biggest problem was the spiciness of everything. Sri Lankan food is  known for being spicy, but I wasn't prepared to handle that level of heat.\n\nWill I go there again? Maybe. The food was extremely cheap, authentic and filling, and if I am cash strapped, i might consider giving this place another visit.

From the moment I got him in January when he was 3 months old he has almost never been without me, except for a few hours. He also suffered from separation anxiety which I'm always working on reducing, since there were times when if I went into a cafe leaving him with one of my friends, whom he knows, he wouldn't stop whining and barking until he saw me again. While those days appear to be behind us I still worry about triggering it again. \n\nSo I was worried when I was dropping him off at Lindsay's for a weekend stay. I thought he'd miss me and mope and sulk and be sad. Boy, was I wrong! By the time I picked him up, I couldn't possibly have been more thrilled with the way it went! \n\nThe pictures Lindsay shared made me wonder how I'd ever thought he'd miss me! Because The Hydrant really is where all dogs want to be! Lindsay took such good care of him, and even when he was the tiniest of all the dogs around I knew I had nothing to be concerned about. The way he is with me, he was literally her shadow, and I know she showered him with love. And Dolce is a super-fussy eater...so when she put up a picture of him having breakfast, I was speechless! That convinced me that he was right at home there.  \n\nOh, the pictures! Lindsay is so awesome, she kept me updated with pictures of him alllll weekend, every few hours, on Instagram, on Facebook! She does that with all her doggy-guests! In fact, it was from following the adventures posted on her blog and her Facebook page that I realised that if I wanted the best for Dolce he would have to stay at The Hydrant when I couldn't be around. I am really, really happy with that decision.\n\nBefore meeting Lindsay I wasn't sure what I would do when I would have to go out of town on a long trip on which I couldn't take my ltitle man, Dolce, with me. Now, I'm so relieved to be able to leave Dolce in her care. I am completely reassured, knowing he's going to be taken care of really well. I mean, come on, she even makes treats for them (Recipes are on her blog)! And he gets to be around his pals all day, all night! I think of it as those sleepovers we all loved when we were little. All I'm afraid of is that he'll become a party animal. I'm sure after that weekend stay he already feels his real life at home with me is dull. \n\nI'm going on a month-long trip soon and the one part I'm not worried about is Dolce. I love him with all my heart and I know he will be loved just as much (if not more) by Lindsay. Thank you for everything you do, Lindsay! Dolce sends his kisses...\n\nP.S. Lindsay also makes the most gorgeous collars, leashes, and Tinkle Bells, for dogs!

Personally I would have preferred the beets plain, not curried.  I think the natural sweetness of the beets would have complemented the other ingredients, but instead the seasoning detracted from it.\n\nReally like the decor with wine bottles, but where I was sitting my elbow kept hitting bottles.  I am an average-sized American, so it would be difficult for big men to feel comfortable here, I imagine.  Then again, it is a renovated bungalow, so if you want quaint and intimate, this is the place.\n\nLike the option of rosemary for the water, too.  Overall a good experience.

The waiter came back and explained that these things happen. Again after a long wait our food finally came. The food itself was pretty good, but they forgot to bring out the Samosas. Finally after complaining after we had finished eating they brought out the samosas, but by that time we were too full to eat them. They also forgot to bring out the sauce. The people at the table next to us were in a hurry (and had told them at the beginning of the meal) and had to leave before their food was served. Another table who's food was also late also ended up getting upset. I know a little Hindi and I think that I heard someone from the backroom swear in Hindi, but I'm not sure.  I know that they won an award last year, and maybe they had different management, but this was a pretty horrible experience and I won't be coming back.</td></tr><tr><td>_PHl9iwvINBhM2EsW9SrFA</td><td>-1</td><td>As a resident of Charlotte and frequent traveller, I fly in and out of Charlotte at least a dozen times a year.

He came back with an outrageous quote, higher then a quote I had received from a previous dealership for a more expensive explorer sport! His due at signing fees were also $1,000 higher then what I was previously quoted from another dealership.  I asked if he could do better and sent him online pricing from an exact replica on the ford website and also gave him the quotes I received from a different dealership and his reply was to go with the other dealership.

We ordered wings, cheese bread and $3 beers. They actually have over 10+ sauces you can choose for their wings: buffalo, bbq, something spicy, something sweet, little bit of something for everyone.

I continued to drink it then I felt something slimy go into my mouth, it seemed like the milk was curdled, or something.  So I went up to the counter to let the employees know that there was something wrong with the hot chocolate.  The lady behind the counter apologized, and told me they will check it out, and offered me a different drink.  I did not want anything in return, I just wanted to tell them about it.  As I walked away from the counter, my girlfriend was sitting at the table looking towards the counter, she saw the lady behind the counter looked to another employee and said \"No, it's fine.\"  They did not check anything and continued to sell the hot chocolate.  I wouldn't have minded as much if I knew they actually tested the hot chocolate.  But they didn't.

First impressions are important and my first thought after 10 minutes was \"wow, what a complete fail\". They weren't even close to being ready to being open. The decor was terrible, if you're one that thinks a painting with a splatter on it is worth 25k then you might be impressed. It came across as cheesy and trying too hard. I've seen others compare it to a poor version of the Cosmo on a budget, with a weird monkey twist. 100% accurate. Hyde has it's quirks but I'm actually a fan so I was really looking forward to LiFE. For an SBE  property to have it's own signature venue you think it'd go far and beyond. I entered and my first thought was it's a cheap knock off of a club from the strip, and we all left feeling the same. The scene was terrible and way over crowded. When we go out at the Cosmo or Wynn I don't mind paying because I'm at a 5 star resort, everything is class and quality, I feel like I get my moneys worth. This place is a 2.5 star resort with higher prices than the Cosmo, go figure. I don't gamble but the guys in our group were underwhelmed by the gaming floor and it did seem super tight. The food was the only bright spot as we ate at Bazaar and we definitely had a great meal. The decor, gaming, nightlife and staff need a complete do over. I'm afraid SBE dropped the ball and if they don't fix it fast, it maybe too late. Went with a party of 9, not one of us left impressed. I think the biggest surprise was how cheap it felt, I think half the budget went to marketing and hype. Save yourself the disappointment, money and inconvenience of leaving the strip for the ghetto and stay away. The reviews don't lie.</td></tr><tr><td>hb0WtRehhsWXRWnkVbIdPQ</td><td>-1</td><td>This place is horrible!

I am fairly sure this was not intentional in design but I'm not sure how it could possibly not be.\n\nThe amenities and the staff are fantastic but the guests are straight up retarded.

I rarely use that particular card so I did discover it missing till then.  Today after tearing my truck and home apart I decided it must be at the last place I used it.  I looked up the number, called and was greeted by Rob. He confirmed the card had been placed safely under the counter awaiting my return.  Now about the people who find fault with this crew, these people complain about everything.  It's unfair that these people pass judgement based on one little thing.

He pointed at the Mazda in a fenced lot and explained that they did still have it but it had been sold yesterday and the person just had not come to pick it up. So now I have no truck and no Mazda.

When you tell them why you have come to the emergency room, they act almost as if you are lying. They'll put you in a room to sit in a chair while waiting for your results and not check on you to see if there is anything that you need and then when you need medicine you have to track down a nurse and ask them, only for them to tell you they have to speak to someone else first. Well then you wait another hour and have to go track down another nurse who then tells you that your original nurse (douche bag Chris) has taken a lunch and will be back later. So then you go through multiple nurses who give you attitude and act like you are the biggest inconvenience to them until you finally get someone who comes into help, but acts like a huge fucking prick. How do you neglect that there is multiple patients sitting all in this one room who need immediate attention and have been asking for help for hours? I finally flipped out and went off on every nurse who came in. What happened to being caring and compassionate towards your patients? Isn't that a part of being a nurse? I understand that you have long days and a lot on your plate, but it's no excuse to treat your patients poorly. I no longer will visit this hospital. Not even if I'm on my death bed. Don't get me wrong, there are less than a handful of nurses who are kind and actually care. I wish I had remembered their names, but they are wonderful. They didn't make me feel as if they needed to get me out as quickly as they can. They made me feel genuinely cared for.

Facilities are impressive--4 or is that 5 pools, 2nd floor with every imaginable cardio machine, full spa service, cafe, metabolic counseling (if I got that right, not sure), day care, trainers, towels, many classes a week included though when I asked about water aerobics she hadn't a clue, and didn't offer to look at the fine print schedule to find out. \nWhen the time came for the locker operation demo, I couldn't get one to work and with two different lockers neither could she. Walked me to another area, said she had to go and turned me over to an attendant. That woman too struck out with two more lockers. The claim was the temporary card was at fault and that as soon as I signed on--up front with $275--I'd get a permanent card that would work better. Patron in the locker room said she had had some issues with the system as well. For me, this was simply unacceptable. I left. \nSo very fancy schmansy in many areas. Basics like locker operation?

No FRESH BERRY PIE WHEN FRESH BERRIES ARE PLENTIFUL & IN SEASON. Waste of time & gas driving there. Big disappointment. \n\nSkipped the blueberry cream cheese too cause when you're craving \"Fresh Berry Pie,\" cooked isn't the same. Also there were super-slim picking in the bakery case, a death by chocolate, a butterscotch & some sort of coffee/mocha. Yikes - CALL if you plan to try it, otherwise chances are they may have slim pickings. The only other time we visited, the whipped cream on top of the Snickers pie was \"gummy/sticky\" as in \"old whipped cream\" that's been left sitting too long. Not as in marshmallow topping. What happened to \"Fresh Pies Daily?\"</td></tr><tr><td>zP0o3z7uznFjPrUMlw7YEA</td><td>-1</td><td>COMPLETELY DISORGANIZED, FAILED TO PICK UP-DELIVER 3 TIMES, NEVER USING AGAIN!!! Initial call and booking very helpful and friendly, pick up scheduled between 8:30am-11am Saturday morning, with an hour ahead phonecall to say the movers were en route. This did not happen. Made follow up calls and given the cell number of the driver by the owner (who had no details of the move). After back and forth and many calls was told the piano would be picked up between 2pm-4pm the same day and would receive a call in advance. This did not happen. The same back and forth happened between the owner, driver and myself and was told that they would definitely pick up between 5pm-7pm. By this point not trusting that this would happen made a follow up call just before 5pm to the driver and was told that it would be unlikely they would pick up the piano before 7pm. The owner is not answering her cell. However friendly at the beginning they have failed to do what the title of the company states they do on 3 separate occasions.</td></tr><tr><td>b6ARs4vpsq4d4PGOIdhSMQ</td><td>-1</td><td>The food is pretty good, definitely above the average and has some different choices. I've had the eggs benedict and costa breakfast burrito (chorizo) and both hit the spot. Very fresh and tasty and the coffee is quite good. \n\nBut what really sets this place apart is the dining experience. I really enjoy the fast casual set up--order, take a number, get your coffee, juice, etc., and wait for your food. There are plenty of tables and the system runs smoothly and efficiently. This process makes me want to go here more than other breakfast places, even ones that may have slightly better food. At the end of the day I don't want to wait an hour no matter how good your frittata is.</td></tr><tr><td>g197qQMAE3bHK4U599HNQA</td><td>-1</td><td>First, the couple good parts: the docs have always been nice and fairly competent. unfortunately, i've had a different one every single time i've been there so I don't have any loyalty to them. the technicians have been fine as well.\n\nBut the rest of the staff...yikes! They are incompetent and downright rude (they were talking crap about me, other customers, other employees in earshot of everyone). I tried explaining that the doctor told me I could go home, call them and tell them the brand, features, etc I was already wearing, and then they would finalize my prescription. The \"lady\" I was passed off to then 1) pressured me to buy contacts from them rather than online and 2) when I refused, proceeded to make it as difficult as possible for me to get contacts from anywhere else. Despite what the doc said, she said that I had to come back for a trial pair because they didn't have any in stock (great!) then I'd have to come back a third time for a follow up. Ridiculous. \n\nThey didn't get the trials in for over a week. I finally made it back in two weeks after that. After more arguing, I convinced them to let me have a follow up right there and then because I was already wearing the contacts I wanted and this time I brought the actual box and contact case with all the information, so I didn't need the trial pair. Doc approved, I grabbed my contacts lens Rx and bounced.\n\nI also needed new glasses but I wasn't giving Nationwide any more business so I went to a Lenscrafters. At Lenscrafters, they needed my eyeglass Rx (Nationwide had only given me a copy of the contact Rx) so they called Nationwide. Nationwide refused to turn over the prescription unless I faxed a release, which of course took them a half hour. The lady at Lenscrafters was stunned. She had never had to do that and didn't even have a release form because most places will just fax the prescription over no problem. \n\nBy the way, you're not a nationwide chain so your name is stupid. Never again, never again.</td></tr><tr><td>wr2FH96QginiIgGLlAOIJQ</td><td>-1</td><td>It's hard to compete with Gallo Blanco (my wife's favorite restaurant in Phoenix) and Otro, the sister restaurant, doesn't quite live up to its predecessor. But it's still a solid choice and a good substitute if you live in the north central area like us. \n\nSo far I've had the carne tacos, carne torta and chicken enchiladas. The first  two feature very tasty and well-cooked carne, and I especially liked the torta. The torta comes with onions, guac (more of straight up avocado really), and a killer aji aioli. Simple and perfectly executed.  They also have very good chips and guac. Again the guac is more chunky with solid avocado pieces but I don't mind that at all. The margaritas hit the spot and I would expect nothing less from the Gallo Blanco's \"Other.\" \n\nMore recently I tried the enchiladas. After I ordered, my wife reminded me that she had gotten them before and wasn't a fan. I have to say that I must agree. There's no cheese on top, which perhaps is the more sophisticated way to go, but I could barely taste the cheese on the inside. The tortilla itself was kind of soggy. The sauce is more of a salsa, somewhat spicy and fairly tasty, but nothing to write home about. The side of black beans was my favorite part. They were very good, but the beans should never be the best part of an entree in my humble opinion (Latin Americans, including my wife, may take offense to that though).\n\nOtro doesn't have the funky charm that Gallo does, but it's coming along. There's a mural on the outside wall of the adjacent building. I noticed on this last trip that they added booths, which makes it feel more put together. \n\nOverall, a good place to get some good, fresh Mexican food and a well-made margarita.</td></tr><tr><td>RyeLo1rFgTx9Eve7FcBVmw</td><td>-1</td><td>I've been here several times and have never been disappointed with my coffees and lattes.

Bottled sodas that you've never heard of; I want to go back just to try more. I got two to take home: a Moxie for myself and this Japanese soda for my wife. The former was very old fashioned (I should have known by the Ted Williams poster they have displayed by the case) and not very good, at least to my taste. My wife's soda was a strawberry-flavored beverage with a really interesting bottle design and mechanism to open. It looked like a baby bottle and you use part of the top to open it...hard to explain.\n\nAs for the food, I had a chili cheese burger that was quite tasty. The burgers are served on large, soft buns perfect for their hefty burger creations. The chili was pretty sold, a firm B+ (nowhere can come close to the best chili cheeseburger in the world, which fyi, is at Tommy Burger in Los Angeles). The fries were just so so, not quite crispy enough.\n\nI'll definitely be back and I'll come with an even bigger appetite, probably for the Philly Burger :)</td></tr><tr><td>N7bZLksOu5fBe2cg5tfoOA</td><td>-1</td><td>It's hard for me to give a breakfast place more than 4 stars, because breakfast is breakfast right? Well, Snooze earns the 5th star because it didn't miss on anything. The wait was an hour long on Sunday morning, but it's a popular place so can't ding them for that. The coffee was really good--you can read the long story about how it's from their partner farm in Guatemala or you can just drink and enjoy. Our group got a variety of breakfast items--French Toast, Corned Beef Hash, traditional Eggs Benedict, Chilaquiles Benedict, Scrambled Eggs. Our kind server also brought us out a complimentary speciality pancake, which was tasty. Everything was on point. The table was silent; everyone was enjoying their meal. I had the traditional eggs benedict (Ham Benedict III). The ham was shaved, which I surprisingly liked. The hollandaise was also light and not overpowering and not too thick. It's a long wait, but worth it.</td></tr><tr><td>eTermnlOdf2X0gbv2emvzA</td><td>-1</td><td>Being that we are fortunate enough to have close access to all the unique dining experiences that living in Toronto brings, dining at the commercial big-box joints are not our thing.

Then a neighbour of ours had nothing but compliments to say, so we ventured in...and we were not disappointed!\nThe service is fantastic, and while the size of the resto and menu appear similar to those big-box types, the food is all homemade, well executed and just DAMN TASTY!\nKobe meatloaf, ribs, burgers were all a hit with our family!</td></tr><tr><td>LVkOhdlb_wyav48g8fsPuA</td><td>-1</td><td>This rating is generous, because zero stars is not an option.\nOn 3 separate occasions I walked into this store to search for books to give as gifts and for my own child.  No sooner than I walked in, I walked out!\nBased on the previous review's comment, I'll assume the owner was working..I'm sorry, but if you own a business in a family oriented community like the Beaches, it is not acceptable to have little to no customer service skills!  If in fact the person I encountered was the owner, shame on you for being a terrible example to your staff.  Your staff should not be better at service than you.\nThe first time I walked into this store, I waited about 15 minutes, during which time I made eye contact with the person working, as well as friendly gestures indicating I needed assistance, and she looked me right in the face, and did nothing, no offer for assistance, nothing.  So I finally asked for some help, and I got a mere 'take a look over there' with a wave of the hand as if to say 'stop bothering me'.\nThe other two times, I wasn't even acknowledged and both times, I was the only customer in the store.\nI'm a huge supporter of local small business and supporting the Beach BIA, but 3 strikes and forget it.

It was actually hotter inside than it was outside of the restaurant.\n\nWhen the food came, it was literally tossed onto the lazy susan and we were actually asked by servers to take the items from their serving trays while they rested the trays on the back of our seats. When one server spilled something on the bill as she placed it on the lazy susan, she took one of my family member's napkins, wiped the bill and just left the napkin. When we asked for another napkin, she just walked away without any acknowledgement. \n\nWe then decided to cancel the remainder of our food order and we asked 10 times of different waiters and waitresses and still the food kept coming. It wasn't until we found a manager that the food stopped but by then we already got the majority of our order.\n\nThis place is an absolute disgrace and any self-respecting person who is interested in a comfortable and enjoyable meal should NEVER COME TO THIS RESTAURANT!!\n\nThe dishes may be cheap but there is absolutely no way in hell it's worth the aggravation to save a couple of bucks. \n\nThis restaurant needs to run itself out of existence and the sooner the better. \n\nThe funniest thing is that the front entrance has a huge picture of Stephen Harper with the chef.

I moved out of state for several months and was unable to cancel over the phone OR put the membership on hold. When i returned, they did offer me 3 months free to help offset the 6 mos i paid and could not attend which I appreciated. However, given the issues continued with instructors, i did not go and decided to cancel. I went in this evening and i missed the cancelation for January by 24 hours so i was billed for January and have access to a gym i won't use through February. Interestingly, they didn't even ask for an ID or proof of my identity so i am not sure why this could not have been handled over the phone 7 months ago when i originally asked to cancel. \n\nMy 2 cents, its a scam. They force you to come in as they know it will take longer for you to do so and they will benefit until you do. Its 2017, i find it hard to believe this company cannot process signups or cancelations via fax, telephone or for goodness sakes the world wide web.</td></tr><tr><td>ykPURm00Nwo7L_kuivS_qw</td><td>-1</td><td>We just had the rudest experience at direct buy.

I replied that closing time was when you stopped letting new customers come in, not when you turned the lights out on your customers. \"Oh, are you still eating?\", she queried. I tried to explain that my wife was still eating and that it was very rude to simply turn the lights out on your customers, especially without informing them that you were closing and going to turn the lights out. I thought about accidentally falling in the dark. I know some attorneys that would loved such a case and I have always wanted my own Subway. I told the young lady that I had never seen anyone so rude. At which she became magically polite and turned the lights back on so my wife could see how to toss her uneaten food in the trash can so that she would not have to clean the table. My wife, being the lady she is, gathered up her uneaten food and all the papers napkins, straw papers (even picking one up out of the floor - which I would never had done) through them all in the trash.

They do get busy at times and serve a variety of clients, from the hard working blue collar guy to the occasional celebrity (no I'm not talking about myself).  The place also has a good display of desserts - both a positive and a negative, mostly a negative right now for me as I am trying to lose a few pounds.  If you have not eaten here, give this place a try, and if you see Jimmie - tell him Eddie sent you by his way!</td></tr><tr><td>m9h2cGL7Rl36cfMNTzDM9w</td><td>-1</td><td>Was upcharged for ordering traditional instead of boneless wings. Several details of our order were not correct. Dressing was supposed to be on the side. Food was almost cold, seemed like it was sitting for a long time before we got it.\n\nOverall bland, underwhelming food. Overpriced for the quality. Felt sick after eating.</td></tr><tr><td>A0dyupINFYxXLcLvDuaXDg</td><td>-1</td><td>Usually love this Boston Pizza but the daytime staff is not as efficient as the nighttime staff. Ordered a pound of wings as our starter and got it at the same time as our entree. The entree was another story. My wife ordered her pasta without mushroom and what do ya know there's mushrooms. We tell our server and she starts looking through the pasta and tell us there's not mushrooms in it meanwhile there's a big piece of mushroom my wife pulled out on the side of the plate. Then a manager comes out and asks what happened we re-explained everything and she said the same thing. Ridiculous service. My wife being allergic to mushrooms isn't gonna chance it and these employees keep trying to tell us there's none it's unreal. I didn't ask for free food or anything jus the food I ordered to be correct. Terrible. My advice go on friday or sat night when Amber or the other nighttime bartenders are working. It's a world of difference</td></tr><tr><td>HjqIumHSawGjt9pmeff-nQ</td><td>-1</td><td>American airlines when they hire customer service and people in airport must have criteria of being rude to customers every person I talked to from the carrier have been rude......American sucks I will never fly it again ever trust and believe that</td></tr><tr><td>KFRbjbn4bKsaSW-3ym0KxA</td><td>-1</td><td>Never done yoga - ever - until a couple of weeks ago. \nI happened upon a FREE class here and it happened to be a hot Bikram class.\n\nTerrified, anxious and clueless - I accepted.\n\nI could not be happier.

Just pick a code for the day.\n\nIf you're curious - do it!\n1st timers - bring lots of COLD water, 2 towels (1 for class, 1 for shower after), yoga mat. \nResist the urge to leave the room.

Do not rent here.  Cockroaches, unclean, toilet had mold, refrigerator constantly leaked water from the bottom which the on-site repair men did not or could not fix, kitchen sink spewed out raw sewage every time it began to rain...disgusting even from day 1.  At move in there was a 1 ft diameter hole in the wall, trash in the kitchen and closet, part of the floor was broken, and though the unit was on the first floor level with the street outside there were 0 window treatments.  Additionally, they hold your mail from you and there are 3 different locations in the building to try to pick it up.  Family members had sent me multiple packages for my birthday which were between 1 - 2 weeks late because the management had them in the front office and told me there was nothing.  On another occasion, the girl at the front desk told the mail man that I had MOVED when I still lived there!  They even put a note on my mailbox saying not to leave my mail for me which caused a mix up for months.  The only way I got their attention is when I brought a police officer with me into the front office to finally clear it up.  They also tried to raise my rent when they saw me walking with my boyfriend once and accused me of having multiple tenants in a single unit.  Completely unprofessional and dishonest people.</td></tr><tr><td>382sCefOsl14JsRAec1s1Q</td><td>-1</td><td>Don't go there if you are looking for Mexican food or you will be severely disappointed.

I feel like their workers are forced by management to upsell to customers their expensive combos. I could've gotten chipotle across the street for less and I consider that a treat as far as fast food goes in between classes (I'm a Ryerson student). the food is cold and bland and overpriced, you're far better off getting pizza anywhere else close by. \n\nI've had sbarros in Wisconsin and Chicago first (which is the only reason why I tried this location) and it was cheaper and better quality. you should leave Canada if you aren't going to honour the standard set by American franchisees.</td></tr><tr><td>gb3-93maT4NwZZT4_pxa6g</td><td>-1</td><td>I recently went here to buy a set of four brand new tires. the price was very reasonable and  the guys didn't take that long to put the tires on. its very clean inside, they have a couch and big flat screen tv to watch while waiting. before i left they i checked out my new tires and found that one tire was missing the valve cap but no biggie, i went inside to ask for an extra one so that i could just screw it on and be on my way, but the guy went and screwed it on for me...they are very polite here! i am going there for my tire needs from now on. they also do other auto work.</td></tr><tr><td>sEyXHvTRUI1R5OOcdfAEZw</td><td>-1</td><td>I was in Vegas for the iHeartradio show and went to Haze after the concert.

Well, obviously, it wasn't cleaned up and as a result I was cut and unable to walk or put pressure on my foot for over 2 weeks. All I was asking was for them to pay my medical bills (which were about $100) and they have refused.   I will never go back to this club again and encourage others to do the same. Unless you plan on walking on glass the entire night. Oh wait, they supposedly clean up after spills.

Our server was not attentive at all we could hardly find him and had to ask other servers for help. At one point the manager told us she would give us a discount on the check for the issues we were having. Well when the check came there was no discount at all. At this point we just wanted to get out of there. If you are going to offer something to customers and they don't even ask then they should follow thru. I emailed the managing partner who responded to me that she wanted to talk with me on Monday and also wanted us to come back and be her guest. She told me to call her between certain time at the restaurant. Well I was not able to call her and sent an email stating that and asked for a time u could. Well I never heard back from her.

They tried telling me that my water was unsafe for any new fish and that they will give me a discount on products I didn't need. I went ahead and purchase an eel from a different store and he has been doing perfectly fine the past 2 weeks.

I have been getting Bio-gel nails for years and have used several places before discovering Daisy Nails. I never have to request a particular aesthetician as all have done a phenomenal job. When I'm having fills done, the aesthetician will also repair any breakages when I've damaged the artificial nail and she'll repair it at no extra charge. When she's done I never know that there has been extra work done on one nail. \n\nNails are always strong and beautiful. I've had them fall off at a couple of other places and never gone back. Not here - they're on solid. The aestheticians always spend careful time on my nails and I never feel rushed. I highly recommend Daisy Nails.</td></tr><tr><td>aQ21DuUk6ZjJBwDOLYceOA</td><td>-1</td><td>I really did love my hair after Josh cut and colored it.

It was a bit more than I'm used to paying, but that's okay, I figured he might be just what I've been looking for.\nWhen it was time to pay, however, it turned out he quoted the CASH price. Paying credit was 10% more, which came to $12.00 in my case. I wish I had taken it out of his tip, but I felt that was unfair. Later I thought HE was unfair for quoting the cash price for something well over $100. I never carry that much cash and I don't know anyone who does.\nNot sure I'll go back, as I felt that was dishonest.</td></tr><tr><td>b5MGQjhL0z1kHoGHmgkrOA</td><td>-1</td><td>I tried to return a bottle of wine here -- let me just say I buy all my wine and groceries here and have never had a problem, but every once in a while you just get a bad bottle of wine. This was my favorite red, it had simply turned. The first thing customer service asked was \"Did you open it?\"  \"Well, yeah.... if I hadn't opened it, I wouldn't know it had turned.\" I said. I just wanted to replace it with the same exact bottle and I told her that. She didn't even ask for the receipt, if she had, she would've seen I had only purchased it a few days prior. She was adamant that they could do \"absolutely nothing\". So I'm out 10 bucks. I had shopping to do, and I tell you, I was seething the whole time. Here it is days later and I'm still upset.

So we got there early, enjoyed a drink around the corner at my fave bar - Merc. And then arrived 10 mins before previews started to order our dinner. It worked out perfectly. I ordered their brisket sandwich concoction - it's not even on the menu yet - and I was quite pleased with it. And my pomegranate martini was delish - a little on the sweet side - but that's what I prefer!\n\nThe previous time we went, we split their queso blanco dip w/chips and thai coconut chicken skewers. The chicken skewers were pretty good, but the queso dip was horrible. Tasted like your typical concession stand nacho cheese. So i would stay away from that.\n\nAll in all, I'm a fan and will be back soon!</td></tr><tr><td>N2d44L-wcwNwPOD36gF7PA</td><td>-1</td><td>Whenever I'm in the mood for Thai, I order some take out from here.

Don't waste your time or money.\n\nMy roommate gave me her Living Social deal for a shellac manicure and a glass of bubbly for my bday.  When I called to make an appointment, they didn't have anything available until two weeks later.  Then, the day before my appointment arrives, the nail girl calls me to reschedule my Friday 6pm appointment to 2pm and leaves me a voicemail telling me to call her back if that doesn't work. When I called her, I let her know I work all day and can't reschedule - she proceeds to list three other times and then was clearly annoyed when I couldn't accommodate her.\n\nSo, finally Friday arrives. I called for directions on my way and the owner answered the phone and was extremely rude.  I arrive right on time and then after five minutes of waiting, I'm told it's going to be another 20 minutes before they could start on my nails.  At this point, I was about ready to walk out.  But I really needed my manicure, plus I wasn't paying for it - so I decided to stay.  She gave me my glass of bubbly to sip while I waited -- too bad there were no bubbles in it. Yuck.\n\nAround 6:30, they finally started on my nails.  The girl was nice but did not do a good job at all - there were visible parts of my nails not painted.  Oh and just a sidenote - not many colors to choose from at all for shellac.  They also didn't soak my nails or anything - but maybe that was part of the deal?\n\nThe place is quite small and looks like a bit of a \"hot mess.\"  Also, there's about three or four seats to get pedicures and three tables where they do manicures - that's it.\n\nI'll definitely be sticking to my fave nail places: Sundrops, Ken's Nails and Seven Day Nail Salon.</td></tr><tr><td>fAlh4a33sLQLjIGT3JtULA</td><td>-1</td><td>Went to Pamplemousse early on a Friday night and were were the only ones there for at least an hour -- I suppose Vegas regulars like to dine later. The ambiance is very old school--lush colors with dimmed lighting--and I felt like I had stepped back to Vegas in the 60s. I could picture Bobby Darin himself sitting at a corner table. We were treated to an entertaining history of the restaurant as told by the head waiter, an eloquent and affable chap who fit the atmosphere perfectly.\n\nThe food wasn't oh-my-god spectacular, but it definitely met with our approval. The fresh vegetable basket was a nice touch, the escargot a little bland, and the shrimp scampi entree didn't stand out. I wish I had sampled some of the more exotic menu choices, but I guess at least I have a reason to go back, which I most definitely will.</td></tr><tr><td>i5ha8eKkKySI9YaYLGk7-w</td><td>-1</td><td>OMG...What a NIGHTMARE! I don't recommend anyone hire a family owned company to do work for you. This leaves you with no one to complain to if things go wrong. I had asked Watts to put up spikes where pigeons were nesting. I came home to a mess, trash and bird poop everywhere. I didn't call,  just cleaned it up myself. 1 week later I found birds nesting out front of  the upstairs windows. While looking on the window sill,  I see several containers of empty bird glue that they left behind. Finally, I called to address the issue i.e.: left trash and bird poop everywhere, basically, leaving me with the same situation I was in prior to seeking their services. I even sent him pictures. The owner was horrible. He called me cheap (I paid $400.00) and said he felt like I was trying to get something for nothing. I hadn't even asked for anything. I Just wanted him to realize the birds were still nesting in places that he didn't put spikes. I needed more spikes.  I never said I wouldn't pay for it. I told him I would share this experience on YELP and he said \"I'll reply to that and really embarrass you.\" I don't know how he will do this, but the fact that he threatens people, may be why he has such good reviews. Because of this issue, I will be unable to use my warranty that was supposed to be good for 5 years.  This guy has used intimidation tactics to ensure he doesn't have to honor his warranty. I hope you all think twice about using this family owned business.</td></tr><tr><td>sZ6tpjfeQAfh45l8W8ZAIA</td><td>-1</td><td>If you want to wait 2 plus hours for very average tasting, under proportioned and over priced food, then this is the place for you.

THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. I was late to my appointment and they still took the entire hour, took their time, showed genuine interest in my pain and my recovery. Quality work while making me understand what the problem is and what it will take for them to help me correct it and what I will need to do on my own to help the process. I learned so much and didn't feel ashamed of how I have not taken care of my body because they didn't allow me to.

I'm assuming they used the same oil to cook fish and chicken in. We couldn't eat it, and we still had to pay for it. When we went to pay (which took 45 minutes by the way) we noticed they added items to our bill we never ordered. After going back and forth we were forced to overpay 140$!! Ridiculous!

We arrived about 10 minutes early and the hostess seated us at the end of the restaurant near the back, facing the wall where the door to the kitchen was and next to it were the washroom doors. There was also a huge draft. The restaurant was completely full except for a few seats by the bar. About 5-10 minutes later, I asked if we could be moved as some customers had just left and I NEVER, EVER do this but I thought since its my moms birthday and there's a few inconveniences, I don't think its unreasonable. Our waiter talked to the hostess and then came back and said we can't move you at this time because there are 2 people waiting at the doors. He avoided all eye contact after this. Another waiter dropped off our drinks and I asked if we could be moved and he said he would get back to me. Another 5-10 minutes later, they allowed us to move and there was no sight of the 2 people that were supposedly waiting at the doors moments prior. This already left a sour taste in my mouth. \n\nWe ordered several times and the food was good but not amazing like my friends had raved about. When we asked for refill of water or any other small requests, we had to ask twice because no one EVER remembered. All in all, the food is good, service is bad and its TOTALLY overpriced for what you are eating and the service you receive.</td></tr><tr><td>dR3cYTVeJ3K12BhlOLiilQ</td><td>-1</td><td>Took a drive through.

We came in last Saturday at 9:30am and were assigned nail technicians Susan and an older, petite lady with black hair named Ben (not sure how she spells it). Susan was good. The other lady had bad attitude and was rushed to get the manicure done. She even kind of threw the gel color palette on the table when I kindly asked to see colors for my gel. Susan was apologetic for her, but no one else was.  We told the salon manager before we paid about the awful service we received from Bahn and she was not apologetic or tried to make it good.

Working with the La Tea Das new team is the definition of a nightmare to the point that I have been waiting for after my wedding to post my review in fear they would ruin my wedding! That's the kind of person Janet (the owner) is. I read the reviews below and I would agree 100% to all of them when Kelly Matthews was on board. And that is when I reached out to La Tea Das to cater my wedding and the first experience was amazing - I felt so confident in her approach, ideas and she even helped me find ways to cut cost and get the most for my money. Well during my engagement Kelly left the company and after working with the owner it was SO clear why! I work in the hospitality industry and I have never been spoken to like that in all my years' experience. I was speechless after our first conversation! She opened the conversation with explaining that Kelly has left and then her second comment was how foolish I was to have my wedding in the location that I had chosen. Excuse me?? My wedding was at the Charlotte Museum of History in their outside gardens - it was breathtakingly beautiful - of course there is a risk for having it outside but that doesn't make me stupid! So she talks for the entire 45 minute call never ONCE asking what I wanted,  what my thoughts were, or how we envisioned our big day. Nothing! She just talked and talked and in this conversation she is adding, adding and adding items to increase my bill of things I never wanted or asked for.  It was clear ALL she cared about was bringing me to the cleaners. So when I tried at a later date to adjust the items to get back into my budget; she told me I couldn't they have already made too many adjustments for me and they can't do anything else. Are you crazy? What are you talking about? We never made any adjustments they were all adjustments you made that your customer doesn't want! I could go on for hours but it's not worth it.\n\nIn the end we were able to get out of the contract and I hired another caterer...Creative Catering that was AMAZING! The food was to die for and the service was perfection. Corey the owner is such a wonderful person he will make you laugh and do everything it takes to make sure your wedding is the best day of YOUR life! And ours truly was...thankfully. Thankfully we were able to run far away from La Tea Das and if you are searching for caterers you should too!</td></tr><tr><td>eQMaHLlVGJdTT96lryee9A</td><td>-1</td><td>I wanted to pick Capriotti's on my way to work but didn't have a lot of time.

I called back after another 15 minutes but no one answered the call. The driver when he arrived said he had left the restaurant with the order only twenty minutes before.

WTH!? place wasnt even busy, by the way. \n\nWe proceed to order food, get our food and have no silverware with which to eat. Person who dropped our food went back to kitchen n dropped off side of bacon,  and left. Bartender never came to see or ask if we needed anything. Some other staff member was behind bar putting glasses away...we were staring at him so we could get his attention, he looks up and quickly asks if we needed silverware. God bless that man. \n\nI had ordered the pancakes, which were very good! I just wish they had a pinch of salt in the batter, or that they had been served with butter. Wait.  OMG! Person next to us orders pancakes and guess what's on her plate? BUTTER! Could i have asked, yes. But it was a combo of thinking that this is how they meant ti be served and enjoyed (without butter), and I wanted to see if anyone, hello? ANYONE would check on how we were doing..!? I mean, my partner's drink was empty, and we had no waters. We were going to order more to drink but why give more money to a restaurant that clearly does not care about our  eating/drinking experience?!\n\nTruly would have been a pleasant experience but the service was weak.

The 3-D movie was interesting and enjoyable for the adults and the kids. Having been to the botanical garden's butterfly exhibit many times and never being that impressed, this setting had so much more to offer. We were allowed to stay in the butterfly area for almost 45 minutes, and we got to see and experience a wide variety of them while in the habitat. HOWEVER, the staff at this facility was grumpy and unpleasant. You would think that a business that caters to families and children would hire people that at least pretended to care about making the trip enjoyable... Especially for $13 per person. It is hard to enjoy any establishment when the people running it are pushy and obnoxious! Not one of them cracked a smile the entire time were there. From the guy running the movie who seemed to want to be anywhere else, to the woman guarding (yes... She is literally guarding it!) the sting ray exhibit, the staff there was sub par at best.

We have lived In phoenix for almost 40 years, and have experienced all of the water parks. From the originals  to the remodels, my husband and I have been to every park in the valley. The renovations on this one are beautiful,  and there is an area for toddlers with real  rides, which is great. Also, The new slides are very impressive. HOWEVER,  this is the  first time I've had to pay for parking at a water park... And at $8 a pop! That price is unreasonable for your average middle class family.  We have bought summer passes to try and off set that, but it doesn't change the fact that the price is absurd. Another concern is that there is only one restroom on the side of the park where most of the rides and the wave pool are. To boot, it only has two stalls on the womens side. Today one of the toilets was broken. There was a line 5 people deep. I let a kid at the entrance know on the way out, and he didn't bother to contact anyone about it and looked like he could have cared less. There are restrooms at the front of the park, but when you've got a bunch off wet kids who need to go, that trek is unappealing at best, not possible if you have a little one who really needs to use the facilities. Perhaps  they should consider investing  some of those parking fees into installing usable toilets for their guests! In addition, There is a station in the kiddie side of the park that has not worked since the area was built.  It contains a bunch if water guns, so naturally for the last two summers it is the first thing my son runs to.... and it has literally never worked.  This park is the only one on this side of the valley. We have lived this way for almost a decade, and were using that location long before Village Roadshow bought it. It has come so far, but unfortunately, prices have skyrocketed along with the improvements. If the facility also had exceptional customer service and high functioning rides and facilities, it would easily off set the price for me. I haven't seen that yet. My hope is that they get it together over the course of this season so that I can make the investment again... or maybe it will be time to try something new next year!</td></tr><tr><td>jq3bIuQzA2QJgpXRq_Rgrg</td><td>-1</td><td>I was referred to this office by my PCP for a few symptoms that I was experiencing. At the time, my doctor suspected that there was an underlying condition that might be causing the dermatological symptoms, but in the interest of being thorough, she wanted me to meet with a dermatologist to get checked out.\n\nMy appointment lasted about 20 minutes. Even though I was a new patient with multiple concerns, I was never assessed by an actual doctor. \n\nI have worked with PAs in other offices that I have visited over the years. They have always been knowledgeable, and met my needs. My concern with Arrowhead Dermatology is that I came to them as a new patient with several concerns, and was never connected to an actual physician. This practice gives the office a conveyor belt feel. Whether this is true or not, it seems as if they are trying to squeeze in as many patients as possible, regardless of the quality of care.\n\nThat having been said, the PA was lovely. She was personable and kind. Unfortunately when you're working in the medical field, strong customer service does not always equal good care. I explained my symptoms to her, and let her know that I had appointments with other specialists scheduled. I filled her in on my PCPs suspicions.\n\nI noticed in her examination she never put gloves on. She wanted a sample, and had me take It myself. She never thouroughly examined any of the areas of concern that I had. She took a few pictures, and gave suggestions as to why she thought two of the issues I was having were occurring. Both suggestions ended up being inaccurate. She was sure that the sample was going to have a specific result, and it came back negative. Almost every assessment she made was wrong. \n\nTwo specialists later, I do know what is causing some of the symptoms I'm experiencing. I did not go to this office expecting a PA for a dermatologist to diagnose a non-dermatological concern. What I did expect was to see an actual doctor, and to get accurate information about some of the things that were happening. I expected to be told to schedule a follow up to discuss results, and evaluate assessments from the other specialists. Instead, I got a bill, and my results on a card in the mail. \n\nWhen I looked up the address online, I noticed this office has a lot of positive feedback about their Botox injections through Groupon. It seems like this is a very strong focus for them. After this experience, I wouldn't recommend Arrowhead Dermatology for serious dermatological concerns. Maybe they should just stick to Botox!</td></tr><tr><td>_wkdEKYAUA64iPJ7BdyM9g</td><td>-1</td><td>My daughter sustained serious injuries to her chin and the inside of her mouth and jaw at school. We brought her to the pediatric ER here. They triaged us right away. She was X-rayed and stitched up within the hour. The staff was kind and professional. It took some time to get the x-rays read causing us to be there for three hours. However, as a way to help pass the time, the child life specialist came by and chatted with the kids. She provided them with a tablet and some fun toys to make the experience a little less traumatic. The doctors and nurses checked on us frequently, and when they realized how long we had been waiting they went and found the radiologist and had the x-rays read right there. This was our first visit here and we were very impressed.\n\nA week later she sustained additional trauma to the injury. The ER provided exemplary care once again treating the issue quickly and sending us on our way in 40 minutes flat.

I went this past Saturday with about 15-20 people.  We claimed our own area on the patio.  Even though only 3 people ordered food (appetizers at $17.00 each) it took 1 hour and 20 minutes for the food to come out! The waitress did not even acknowledge this and when I asked her after one hour what was taking so long she said \"kitchens busy\".  Our waitress was acting SO overwhelmed I really think she must have been new.  She got everything wrong, looked like she was going to cry and was extremely extremely rude. I'm still angry about her attitude two days later.  All the staff were rude especially the D-bag doorman guarding the patio.  Everything was horrible but most of all... the food. I was starving, waited and hour and 20 and STILL didn't eat it.  That's how bad it was.  It might as well have been Styrofoam.  It's time to remove this place Toronto.....</td></tr><tr><td>IxHSSjh-XXfrPJ4Veu_PlA</td><td>-1</td><td>So far the margs were three sips and way too expensive, the gauqamole was bland and has middle eastern pomegranate in it, the salsa red and green is less than Pace one of my lessor salsas let's see where the entre takes me. The brought me a bowl of red salsa, the waiter was from Wisconsin and the manager was a young blonde woman that knew nothing about Sonoran Mexican food. Another corporate top off trying to bill themselves as upscale Scottsdale and an absolute food failure\n Stick to anything that ends in berto may not have atmosphere but the price is right and the food is authentic</td></tr><tr><td>bfrZ1AX_bundZ5mN1-DRbw</td><td>-1</td><td>The outside atmosphere and view of the lake were lovely. The wine shop well stocked with a nice variety and wide range of prices.\nI had the escargot and was very disappointed. Very bland flavor lacking garlic and wine. The seared scallops were cooked perfectly and accompanying vegetables were sparse but tasty.\nMy son had the French Onion Soup, another big disappointment. The beef stock was too beefy and overbearing, almost had a tomato flavor (how they did that we can't figure out). The cheese was a weak gruyere, if it even was gruyere. His steak was served rare as asked for, but the sauce was a little runny and not what he expected. The bleu cheese was blended into the sauce and would have been better in visible chunks on the filet.\nMy husband was happy with the foie GRAS and with his duck.\nBut when the coffee came with half and half in tiny  pre-packaged containers, that did it. Where was the Creme? The menu is French influenced, but I have a hard time considering this a truly French restaurant.</td></tr><tr><td>LB359aMF73W7wyk56tKpeg</td><td>-1</td><td>Worst customer service I've ever experienced.  These girls need an attitude makeup.  They don't know what's going on.  Service outside was soo slow, the waitress had to come outside and take our order twice.  We moved inside and they can't seem to do a simple task of transferring the bill.</td></tr><tr><td>bePmsTz3w3u0gm3E45jtXA</td><td>-1</td><td>Worst Fish and Chips I've ever had. Breading was wet around the fish. I couldn't tell the difference between the breading and the fish. To top it all off there was a guy next to me at the bar that was vaping so hard and blowing it all across the bar. It's hard to eat fish when all you smell is strawberries. I thought vaping was considered smoking and not allowed in restaurants. The management needs to be more present in my opinion.</td></tr><tr><td>2ZcUcMeDvpWF5gU7vVYi6w</td><td>-1</td><td>First of all I loved Bonchon and was so excited that they finally reopened but since they just reopened the food lacks its normal flavor. The customer service here is the absolute worst, we paid $51 and we waited 40 minutes to get our food to go and when we finally got it we checked the bag and the order was wrong. We ordered the large chicken fingers but instead we got the medium chicken wings. We went to the host and asked for them to correct the order so she grabbed the manager (the Asian lady with the light brown contacts) and instead of being nice and help make sure we got what we wanted they were talking down to us saying it was our fault and that we were lying. All we wanted was to get the food that we ordered and did not mind waiting but the fact that they were so rude and demeaning turned me away from this place.</td></tr><tr><td>gUZQhdq_3lJu__l97f3fmw</td><td>-1</td><td>When this salon first opened I liked it because they were very sterile and clean and had very good customer service. NOW they aren't as friendly, use old polish that needs replacing and they either rush your service or make you wait. I got an eyebrow wax and a pedicure last Thursday evening. I left there with wax residue on my face and the tech had to touch up my toe nail polish 3x before I left because it was old and was so transparent as it dried. She kept adding acetone to the polish bottle. And a couple of Sundays before I waited 45 minute before I walked out because I was never served. They should have a sign that says they don't welcome walk-ins if they can't accommodate. Time to find a new salon.</td></tr><tr><td>KkP1_7NTLhNHBHCluskTBQ</td><td>-1</td><td>Salad bar choices are average with a limited selection.  Selection of meats where limited, with emphasis on chicken and sausage and pork.  Service of meat was slow.  Some of the meats where dry and grizzly.  Desert bar was also limited.

You would've thought they would gear up for this week of business!</td></tr><tr><td>uV1WAZ5g4UP0-iigITBV4Q</td><td>-1</td><td>Small and intimate locale with some good eats (and some misses). My bf and I came based on a friend's recommendation. \n\nFor appetizers, we got the wild mushroom torte and the wild boar spring rolls. We wouldn't normally get that much before the entrees but I was starving that night and just couldn't wait! The torte was a bit bland - I think it would have fared better with some sort of sauce accompaniment. And the spring rolls were a bit burnt. I think the issue was that their spring roll making technique was off.  It was made too loose, causing the filling to be exposed to the hot oil, resulting in it being oily and slightly burnt on the ends. \n\nThe saving grace were the entrees. I ordered the Cornish Hen, which was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, and paired well with the roasted heirloom carrots, bitter greens, roasted potatoes, and roasted onion jus. The bf ordered the pappardelle, with braised rabbit, buttered leeks, apricot preserve, parmesan cheese, and sautÃ©ed greens. \n\nAll in all, based on my one time experience, if I were to come back, I'd probably opt for the entrees and pass on the appetizers.</td></tr><tr><td>5BjWClygmVHHl3PO4lRh1g</td><td>-1</td><td>I was very disappointed in the brisket sandwich.  I love brisket but I never saw meat that looked liked this.  Apparently is was overcooked and should have been disposed of instead of severed.  The cole slaw was just so so and I expected something better because they must serve alot of it.  The service was slow and the waitress was uninterested in us.  I won't go back.</td></tr><tr><td>6x1WnnzOUGZbsO4hH_B4-g</td><td>-1</td><td>I leave my dr appointment (madison) at 6:40 and am told my prescription has been called in.

The 3 groups consist of \n1- main dish & fries. We got two mini burgers & chicken strips. \n2 - fruit: mix of grapes, melons, & pineapple.\n3. Vegetables: mix of carrots, cucumber,  &  celery. With side ranch. \nAll for $6. I've paid more at other places and gotten much less quality food.\nI got the BBQ boar sandwich with sweet potato fries - worth the up charge. \nWe went on a Thurs and had no wait at 5:20.

We waited until they got the drinks for that table. .. with still no service we decided to move.... mind you its 5:00 and there are 2 other parties in there.

Me and my brother went there for the first time and he did enjoy the food, however I wasn't that pleased. Place is really classy and goes with the food. I ordered shrimp tacos too and asked if they have anything spicy to put in it, since I was in a mood to have some spicy shrimp tacos. The waiter suggested something which was terrible when tasted. It was nothing close to spicy and I could not even feel a taste. If they couldn't make it spicy they could have just told me and I would not have spent my money on that. The only dish I loved was nachos with lobster dip!\nOver all may be check all the reviews for the dishes and go before.

First time I went I was asked to sign up for a membership of $59 per month if I wanna use it every month. I felt it was a real good deal and I did sign up. After three months of charging my card and two cancelled appointments they tell me I am being charged for not showing up for the appointment. I was so damn furious, I asked them why didn't anyone tell me about the cancellation fee when I was signing up and they simply said it was on the paper you signed up. I am like who reads that. I lady who spoke to us while signing up told us about the payment procedure and if we ever decide to cancel the membership we should give one month notice. No one ever mentioned that if you miss your appointment we will fucking rip you for $60 for making us book the appointment. I mean, how hard is it to mention that there will be a cancellation fee??? They played really well and I lost $180 that's three months for nothing. I cancelled my membership with them.

It was hands down the best sandwich I have ever had.

With no hesitation she was so cool and changed our order (I know, we're such jerks.)\n\n Our salads arrived and we had no silverware. I thought maybe it was an \"eat with your hands\" kinda place?! Haha nah we flagged down another server who brought us some dinglehoppers. \n\nI got the Caesar salad and the Ultimate Feast! That was a lot of food. Hubs got the crab pasta with a side of coconut shrimp and uncle got the steak and lobster. The food is exactly how you might imagine. Pretty mediocre but not awful.

That's the best!</td></tr><tr><td>uwlM81C7zi4_1LlOT3gR0Q</td><td>-1</td><td>First time here....it was good. My second time, oh man. The rice was hard and fell apart. Tempura was flavorless.

But the worst part is that I was fed up and just wanted to leave since I could see the were trying to rip me off.. So I told them I want to go.

Bed unmade, towels not replaced, room not tidied.  Day 2 far better, day 3 I had a fancy diamond-shaped toilet tissue fold... is this my 3rd different housekeeper??) and employees otherwise seemed bothered by guest presence.

They get one star becuase the staff was friendly. After the reviews, I chose to give this place a try and I was very pleased when I entered.  For a long story short, I came to get a mani and pedi and also came in with a picture of what I wanted. I was told right away that it could be done (one chevron nail, one ombre glitter, and the rest a full color). She started with the pedicure and needless to say, after telling me it would be an extra $10 for the big toe to match the ombre glitter I wanted on my nail, I asked for a hand drawn flower (didn't mind paying the extra $5). She was not able to do it and called someone else to do it (Jenny) After 2 tries, she got it right and I wasn't in love with it, but it wasn't bad. \n\nThe manicure was the worst, literally almost had me in tears. The ombre glitter nail was half-assed and the chevron was a joke. 3 different people attempted just to tell me my nails were too small. Seriously?? First attempt was with the stamps and she could not get it right (smeared on the nails and crooked). Second attempt was with stickers which were way too big, and the 3rd attempt was hand drawn which was attempted by two people but my frustration would not allow me to accept less than what I asked for. I did not walk out of there with what I wanted after being assured it could be done.  They talked their native language, clearly talking about my unhappiness and one lady even threw her hands up and said \"whatever\". I almost cried. They made me feel like asking for good work was expecting too much but they had no problem ensuring I paid the $85. \n\nIf my husband hadn't already paid, I would have asked for a discount. And I had my toddler with me who was starving after sitting there for 3 hours very patiently, so I didn't have the energy to complain... i just wanted to leave there.  \n\nI really wanted to like this place, but I can't waste good money on mediocre work :( I wish I would have been able to try Amanda or Jenny as they recieved several good reviews.</td></tr><tr><td>mvnBxGR1faJf-upuK0Tmgg</td><td>-1</td><td>If you're looking for anything more than a regular car wash, do NOT come here.

The tacos are served on flour tortillas with lettuce and cheese and tomatoes. I'm a corn tortilla onions and cilantro kinda girl myself- but even past that the tacos are poorly done. They use a lot of fatty low quality ground beef and even their enchiladas are sloppy and disgusting and the Chile Rellano is literally sitting in an ocean of grease. I assume this is the kind of place people go to drink with large crowds knowing the food is gross. Overall: Not authentic and the quality is terrible. If you are craving Tacos go to Maize. If you want to sit down and skip the crowds Mas Amigos is so much better. This place is basically a taco bell with a wait staff! Eek Me thinks not!</td></tr><tr><td>d1aHbEThL4K14cPiq5CYTw</td><td>-1</td><td>The service is the absolute worst. Time after time I ask myself why I keep coming here.

Service was quick and attentive....even though I was the first to order and had to wait about 5 extra minutes AFTER everyone else got their order.....Strike 1.\n\nI got the Malay Sauce dish with chicken and shrimp. They give you LOTS of fried rice (or any rice you order) which makes the plate look deceivingly large, but in reality it is NOT that big of a portion....whic is OK for lunch. But the chicken and shrimp portions were unusually SMALL (i.e., not that much of it) and they were definitely skimpy on the Malay Sauce. Strike 2.\n\nThe flavors were.....somewhat BLAND. Not bad, but compared to something like Hasaki Grill, they just cannot compete. Strike 3.\n\nNot horrible but given the Uptown choices (Room 112, Hasaki, Enzo, etc.) there are FAR better choices than Fujo.</td></tr><tr><td>SQXukl9z_YWBsasg3V137w</td><td>-1</td><td>Best sushi I've ever had.

And was told that if someone comes in and wants that room they will get it so we were stuck with the room they had given us! Even though we had reserved and paid for the room 3 weeks prior. \nWe ended up leaving and getting a room at the Aria for half of the cost!! \nI will never ever stay in one of their rooms ever again, even if it was free. \nWe liked what the whole Hard Rock theme and history of the place was. But sadly in today's Las Vegas they give low quality service at a low budget resort. Now it's just a place of things that used to be. And I gave this place 1 star too many. They should change the name to Hardly Rock.</td></tr><tr><td>Ay8Uvg2I-RX0B-E1Thdg8A</td><td>-1</td><td>This place is just a hype.

When you are paying $150 for a steak you should be able to chose the steak sauce you want with it, instead of being looked at like your crazy for wanting to put a little A1 on their so called high end piece of meat. \n\nThen they have a bunch of creepy male waiters wearing all black and when they are serving you, they lean into your personal space. It makes dining a horrible experience. \n\nFor a high end restaurant in a high end hotel on the strip in Las Vegas you would think they would be able to hire a few female waitress so that people don't feel like they are being served by some creepy club security guards! \n\nAs for the rest of the food it was mediocre and definitely not worth $1000 for a party of 4!!\n\nI am only comparing this place to the other high end steakhouses I go to. And this will be one that I will not be returning to.</td></tr><tr><td>Yht-7IQ6PMH0_7wm07usJQ</td><td>-1</td><td>Front desk did not do her job fully and not clear the insurance like all the other walks in did.

The enchilada was missing the guacamole as the girl doing the assembly wasn't paying any attention to what the customers wanted. The burrito was good, the beef is tasty and nice and tender.

Here's why:\n-Location. It's peaceful and away from the chaos of the strip, but is close enough if one would wish to indulge in said \"chaos.\"\n\n- Rooms are pleasant. The entire resort consists of spacious suites that are extremely clean and modern enough in looks. The bathrooms have a shower as well as a decently sized hot tub. The full size kitchens look new every time I stay here and I try to utilize it as much as possible. The suites also have fireplaces (idk who would use it in Vegas but it's there) and a balcony. The one thing I would change is the television. It doesn't run in HD and is a tad bit small.\n\n-Customer service is impeccable! This is also an important one for me because there is no greater upset than horrible service. The employees are always there when you need them, quick on requests, and really friendly. One employee in particular even remembers my family lol.\n\n-Price. This is probably a biggie for many, including myself. I believe on average rooms run about 150/night during busy weekends but there are deals you can find online for 99/night. Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile purchase.\n\nThere are other amenities such as a lounge, meeting room, bar, and fitness center. The fitness center if ok, nothing special.</td></tr><tr><td>iuEEQSj3qaYumZta1jMwZw</td><td>-1</td><td>Mixed feeling about the place.\n\nRoberto's is around the corner from the house and it is opened for 24 hours. For a person on the edge of starvation at 3:30am, this was the perfect spot.\n\nThere are pros and there are cons just like everywhere else, but my experience seriously split my decision right in the middle.\n\nPrice:\nReally cheap in price. I would even compare some of the items to fast food prices. I paid less than 4 dollars for a chicken burrito and 5 dollars for a torta de asada.\n\nSpeed and Service:\nStandard service and attitude. I didn't expect a burst of excitement at 3:30am but I do appreciate them not being sluggish and distant. Food was given to me quickly. By the time I packed my sauces, the food was ready and I was on my way.\n\nFood Quality and Quantity:\nAs you would expect from the low prices, nothing is ever too good to be true. The very affordable prices start to reflect onto my meal as I sink my teeth into the burrito. Oh what a shame that the first bite just happened to be the worst. The entire burrito was bland and unbelievably dry! What I did enjoy was the fact that it was completely stuffed with chicken. If it wasn't for the lime and salsa, I wouldn't have finished it (but in all honesty, I would have because Im a human dumpster when it comes to finishing food). Now the (Carne Asada) torta was pretty good. It tasted like my expectations and there wasn't anything wrong with it. It also wasn't the best I've had, but I would reorder it for sure.\n\nOverall, not my first recommendation during the day time but it gets a \"sure, why not\" as the hours pass into late-night.</td></tr><tr><td>MDEGiXR8C3WzYNlbJsbTsQ</td><td>-1</td><td>Krys is the absolute best.

I was huge fan of the prior takeout location, see my previous review.  One of my comments, in the prior review, stated that a sit down location would be awesome.   Wellllllll be careful what you ask for.  I visited this past Friday evening.  The restaurant was pretty quiet, just a few other customers, more takeout/delivery orders, it seems.  I was dining by myself.  I was seated and 1 server took my drink order, while another server swept the floor nearby.  I recognized the owner, behind the counter, from my visits to the previous location.  He greeted me warmly, as he always does, to all customers.  From there, it went downhill.  The server that had been previously sweeping the floor, approached to take my order.  I ordered my favorite items, Vegetable Biryani and Samosas.  I asked the server if the entree would be accompanied by naan bread, as some of the other entrees on the menu, she stated that she believed so.  She returned a short while later, to tell me that my Biryani didn't come with naan, but did come with.....and she proceeded to spell out something she couldn't pronounce or describe.  It was so awkward, that I told her that whatever came with the entree was fine.   I proceeded to wait, thinking that the Samosas would arrive as my appetizer, they did not.  My appetizer and entree (including the item that the server couldn't describe, still not sure what it was), arrived about 25 minutes later.  The Samosas were just as I remembered, warm/tasty, not quite as spicy as they used to be, though.  The entree, was not the same, as I had on numerous occasions at the prior location.  This version of the Vegetable Biryani, didn't have the same texture, depth of flavor, nor the same ingredients.  The previous version, had firmer rice, toasted cashews, whole indian spices and the mild version was sufficiently spicy.  This version was a soft bland rice, with frozen mixed vegetables and a few potato cubes.  The accompanying chips?, were pretty decent, reminded me of a cross between a kettle chip with the texture of an asian shrimp chip.  I was never offered a refill on my water.  I had been finished with my dinner for at least 10 minutes, complete with stacking the dishes in the middle of table to signal that I was finished.  No one ever brought the check, even as I started to put on my coat.  I approached the counter to pay my check and left.  I probably won't return.  I miss the old place:-(</td></tr><tr><td>_8ueDog9ruHfYBmljz3VKw</td><td>-1</td><td>Wow!!!!!  I would rate Pierogi Palace at 6 stars if I could!   I have passed this place soooo many times, not realizing what I had been missing.   I dined at Bistro 185 a few weeks ago, my dinner entree was just ok, but the pierogi side was outstanding.  In making small talk with the server, he mentioned the piergois came from Pierogi Palace.   I made it a point to visit this past Saturday afternoon, and the counter-person could not have been nicer.  I mentioned to him, how I found the place, and inquired as to what variety I would have had at Bistro 185.   He mentioned potato/cheese/garlic.  The price, $1.00 each or $12 per dozen.  I happily ordered 1 dozen, which had just been made the day before.  He also mentioned that there is a 5 day shelf-life, before they need to be frozen.  I prepared them last night for dinner, sauteing with onion in butter and olive oil and the end result was OUTSTANDING!!   My family really enjoyed these pierogis.  I can't wait to return to try other options!</td></tr><tr><td>OATWY0uGXmxVBA1d6Wmr5w</td><td>-1</td><td>Sokolowski's was just ok for me.  I do think that as a native Clevelander, you have to visit this place at least once in your life, which I've done.  I was in the area on a Friday afternoon, and decided to stop here.  As others have mentioned its more of a no-nonsense, self service type of place.  Didn't quite know where to park or enter, but figured it out.  Same thing once I entered the building...do I go left/right etc.  I found my way to the line for food and grabbed a tray, the silverware was somewhat hidden, so I missed it, the first time and had to pardon my way back thru the line to retrieve.  Anyway, I bypassed the desserts, which are displayed first.  I then proceeded to the soft drink station for an iced tea.  Now to the actual food.  I opted for the stuffed cabbage which was not visible on the steam table, I saw the person in front of me order it and the server produced it from behind the counter.   On a side note, couldn't find a menu nor pricing, so had no idea what was being offered and how much it cost.   The server mentioned that I get 2 sides.  I opted for corn and vegetable medley.  I just couldn't will myself to get mashed potatoes or pierogis with the massive cabbage roll.  I was given a plate for the salad bar.  Another side note....had no idea where the salad bar was located.  Also grabbed a roll from the shelf above the steam table.  I proceeded to check-out and my total was $17+, which I thought was a little bit pricey, but oh well, too late.  I lifted my tray and proceeded to find a seat.  In looking for a seat, I did see the salad bar, not much to choose from, so I just got some mixed fruit, which was a combination of fresh and canned fruit.  Once I was finally seated, I proceeded to taste the food.  The cabbage roll was big, but wasn't hot in the middle, of the roll.  The veggies were ok.   Overall, I'm glad that I finally had a chance to try this restaurant, but not sure that I would return anytime soon.</td></tr><tr><td>HWS0SXc72Kj9oE4uE-rIhA</td><td>-1</td><td>Taco Local had been on my bucket list for some time, had an opportunity to stop on a Thursday afternoon, after work.  The place was fairly empty, just 1 couple, in addition to myself.  I sat myself, as the sign in front directed.  I immediately looked for a drink menu, wanted a margarita.  The server informed me that the establishment doesn't have an alcohol license therefore they only have beer and frozen margaritas from a machine.  I I had my heart set on some street tacos and a margarita, at that point I referred back to the placemat menu and decided to order a bowl.  The bowl gives you a list of options to choose from, you choose your protein, sauce and a dressing.  The dressings were weird, for a mexican style bowl, the choices were avocado ranch, sherry vinaigrette  honey mustard and something else. I opted to not get a dressing  but I did add the cheese sauce and sour cream there was not an option for pico or salsa so I did order a side of that. The order took a little longer than I thought it would and I was not impressed once it was delivered.  The bowl consisted of a base of power greens, arugula, iceberg, kale and shredded brussel sprouts, which I normally love, this was a miss for me, the brussel sprouts were really thick and woody, very hard to chew.  There was also a smooth black bean sauce, which looked unappetizing and tasted awful, not sure, why the black beans needed to be made into a sauce instead of just plain black beans.  There was very little chicken, and it was chopped so fine I could barely taste it. The whole Bowl was drizzled in sour cream with smoky queso on the side, and thank goodness the queso was on the side because it didn't taste good either.  There was also a small scoop of flavorless rice.  Thank goodness I ordered the side of salsa which at least added a little bit of flavor to the Bowl but other than that this was a big disappointment, I couldn't finish it all especially the side of the bowl with the black bean sauce. And last but not least after I settled my bill, I saw numerous flyers and signs posted around the restaurant stating that Thursdays from 5 to 9 was Girl Power Day and everything on the menu is half off, I was charged full price even though I arrived after five o'clock, since I had already settled my bill I didn't bother go dispute it, but shame on my server!  I won't return.</td></tr><tr><td>3qTKT2B0UMpvY_A9ZTRU1Q</td><td>-1</td><td>I rent a lot of cars for work, and I decided to try somebody different for a personal rental since they were a bit cheaper.

When I opened the box it looked like it was a tad overdone and they barely put any cheese on it! There were spots where cheese was missing! I'm not paying to get extra cheese as a topping for them to get it right. It's ridiculous! It's a crime to leave bald tomato sauce patches on a pizza unless it's Neapolitan style pizza from a fancy pizza restaurant. \nI had to eat so I ate it anyway and it was all right, but I felt a little sick afterwards, but this was probably due to pepperoni pizza has a lot of grease that didn't agree with my stomach.

Their ceviche de camaron is made PERFECTLY. So much flavor, and you can tell the shrimp has been marinated in the citrus. (Most places have pretty bland shrimp, like they cooked the shrimp thoroughly beforehand, robbing it of all its flavor). I still get a fresh, sliced avocado on top like they do in the restaurant, which I love. Before, I ordered the asada quesadilla and this time I got the asada fries--both incredible! They used thick cheddar slices for my fries, so it's perfectly covered. Delivery takes awhile, about a little over an hour with me being only about 3.5 miles away. But it's worth it to me; the ingredients are so fresh and it tastes like real homemade Mexican food, not the chain store crap. My absolute favorite place to order from!</td></tr><tr><td>9ZQHddPtlGMU_zFvQVyuQw</td><td>-1</td><td>This agency conned me into getting a life insurance policy without disclosing their intent. They told me I qualified for a decrease in my premium as a safe drivers' discount. When I went in to do the paperwork (which should have been a red flag) no one mentioned a life insurance policy, and I asked repeatedly if I had to pay anything to get the discount (because I've had several other hidden fees in the past with this agent). The reps insisted there was no charge, and then I saw a $35 charge on my card the next day.\n\nWhen I called to ask about it, I was told that was my life insurance policy that I never asked for, nor was I informed was part of my discount, so I was livid. Actually, my exact words were, \"Wow, you guys did it again!\" and the rep's response was, \"OMG IT DIDN'T COST YOU ANYTHING!\" - not offering to look into it or explain anything. When I reminded her that it actually did cost me $35, which was the reason for my call, she stammered a bit, but held her ground that they did nothing wrong.\n\nBy then I had already been with them 2 years and never spoke to the agent, JoAnn Cuevas, one single time until I finally lost my patience with her staff. I've had hidden charges for changing my autopayment date (which I was not advised of beforehand), and more hidden charges when they never actually changed the date (another charge to keep the payment date the same) but then finally remembered to after being reminded (another charge to change it like they should have in the first place). Each charge was the amount of my premium, split into 4 payments on TOP of my existing premium. With all of the consistent errors, I was paying more than I needed to nearly my entire time with this agency.\n\nThen I FINALLY got to speak to the agent, whom was always too busy beforehand to speak with me about previous disputes. My remark of, \"I can't tell if it's the insurance company that's terrible, or just this agency,\"  turned out to be the secret passphrase to speak with Ms. Cuevas herself. \n\nEven when I spoke with her, she did not apologize or offer to remove the policy without me being charged with a fee (you guessed it, in the amount of my premium) - she actually tried to sell me on the idea of having life insurance. It wasn't that I didn't find it useful, it's that they used gaslighting tactics to give me the additional coverage in the first place. She also defended her staff whom I've had consistent problems with. I reminded her that I had nothing but issues for 2 years, and she glossed over them and tried to appease me by saying they were no longer there. Her staff that just screamed at me 5 minutes prior for their own error was still there, though, so I'm sure they're just following behind her and her schemes. \n\nI switched agencies and haven't had a single problem since. I've been with this new agent for about 2 years now, so it's safe to say the problem IS JoAnn's agency. Her staff has proven to be incompetent, at least with my file, and she has proven to be too prestigious and entitled to speak with the commoners unless her agency is being slandered. \n\nThe only reason I ended up with her agency was by recommendation of Centennial Toyota because she's 3 minutes away from there. So let this be a WARNING to those being recommended to this agency by the nearby auto dealerships - there are other agencies nearby that are a better option in my experience.</td></tr><tr><td>hxv0P5ccY51DmMV2IrPw8Q</td><td>-1</td><td>The delivery of my online order was canceled and rescheduled four times - each time with just a few hours notice and after I had taken the day off work to accept the delivery.

Located conveniently near Hwy 60 and Cooper Road, it is in a small industrial building across the street from a nice shopping complex.  I was relieved to learn that EZ Medical Store offers medical equipment for rent or purchase, and that the rental fees for a wheelchair were convenient and reasonable ($35 for a week).  \n\nEven better, they had so many wheelchairs in stock that it was not even necessary for me to reserve a wheelchair in advance. The first time I rented a wheelchair, I walked into the Store, provided my personal information and credit card, and walked out with a wheelchair.  One of the helpful attendants showed me how to open and close the wheelchair for storage, and then carried the wheelchair out to my car for me and placed it into the car (THANK YOU!).  \n\nI was happy enough with the service to rent from them a second time, and this time, one of the managers suggested a scooter rental instead of a wheelchair and so I took home a scooter instead. \n\nAt first, I had been concerned that there would be no way I could get a scooter into my small car, but the manager showed me how easy it was to take apart, and how difficult to break (Ms. Fumbly Fingers here.).  He showed me how to use it, and then with his guidance I took it apart and put it into the trunk of my car (small Toyota) myself so I'd remember how to break it down for transport.\n\nThe real win, the real reason I went to Easy Medical Store made itself apparent when I surprised my Dad with a scooter instead of a wheelchair.  His eyes literally lit up, and the next day, he asked if he could take the scooter for a spin outside, and spend time outside walking with our family.  What a huge relief.  He proceeded to use the scooter nearly every day, which was a relief to our family.  Seeing him active, feeling empowered driving a scooter instead of a wheelchair, and having him get some sun on his face for a couple of days was very important for all of us.  \n\nHad it not been for Easy Medical Store, I would never have considered a scooter, because I thought it would be too big and too expensive for us to manage.  But, it made a big difference for my Dad and my family.  You can't buy moments like that - Thanks Easy Medical Store.</td></tr><tr><td>UDE0UGaRiZmWgemuXoY1bA</td><td>-1</td><td>I really wanted to like this place because of the HH specials, but the service was unbelievably horrible. It was 4pm on a Sunday and not very busy. We sat for 15 minutes without anyone greeting us or bringing water. I ask the hostess to let our server know that we are ready to order, we had a move to go to at 5pm. I go back to the table and sit for awhile with no response, then I ask the hostess to seat us in a different section where we could possibly have our order taken. A short meeting take place at the hostess stand where she explains the situation to two servers who eye me up and down and clearly decide that they do not want to serve our table (I am a brown woman). I tell the hostess we just an appetizer and a drink, if she could just put in the order. Eventually someone comes over, I do not think he was even a server and was just trying to help out. We gulped down our nachos in under 10 minutes and were still late to our movie. I'll go to Blue Agave next time, it's a little further from the theater but the service is reliable.</td></tr><tr><td>ntCj4csi-LXqb4mMfHvNQA</td><td>-1</td><td>The spa facilities were outdated and the staff was pretentious. The women's steam room and jacuzzi needs a serious makeover. They asked charged my credit card for gratuity before I even had services and then added extra charges for spa access after I checked out.

I would never go here for a spa treatment again.</td></tr><tr><td>Elmnwehd5fWhSzmQhstLoA</td><td>-1</td><td>Terrible package booking. Booked at the website and was charged full amount on credit card.

I had heard it was unbelievable.  My table started with chips and salsa. There were 3 salsas, two of which were wonderful. The third,  salsa DE arbol was supposed to be spicy, but it was bland and not spicy at all. I ordered the Korean taco. The meat was cooked perfectly but the Korean sauce was extremely salty. The peanuts added a nice crunch but overall, it was an average taco. Another diner ordered the Baja tacos. They were also nothing special as far as fish tacos go. The highlight was the potatoes bravas. They were really flavorful and crispy. Overall, I felt slightly let down. Maybe too high of expectations,  or maybe there are too many other quality places to grab tacos, so I just wasn't impressed.</td></tr><tr><td>qzGnACE_s6ObTumu10dcmw</td><td>-1</td><td>Absolutely the worst food -- not just Chinese food, but food in general -- I have ever had delivered in my entire life!

Not a big deal, hair grows back. But once you cut it, there's no undo button. So I didn't get what I paid for. I ended up with a close to shaven head instead of what I asked for. Not to mention, uneven sideburns haha. \n\nIn addition, it bothered me that he didn't care at all about all the hair on my face. I had to ask him several times to brush the hair off my face, it was going in my eyes.\n\nMaybe the guy is new, there were obviously some language/interpretation issues. Clearly I could have communicated better. But bottom line for me is this: basic haircut language like \"can you make my sideburns shorter\" while pointing to sideburns, NEEDS to be understood. \n\nHe was apologetic, I told him it's fine.\n\nBut for me, it's not fine. It's $30 for a haircut I don't want. And I won't go back.</td></tr><tr><td>lIF9mSCL0Jy3ADaJUvlo4w</td><td>-1</td><td>Yelp needs a zero stars option. Simply put, this store is an embarrassment. Not just to Apple, but to the retail industry. The staff at the Eaton's Center Apple Store is unreliable, unorganized, and proud of it. \n\nI buy the very top of the line products from Apple. I love them, care for them, and respect the work that went into creating them. Whenever they don't work as they're supposed to, which seems to be happening more frequently the last couple of years, I am forced to deal with the complacency, rudeness, and lack of professionalism by the staff at this store. I've had enough - I'm taking to Yelp with hopes that someone who can fix this will read it. \n\nThey are consistently 20-40 minutes late with their appointments, demonstrate zero customer empathy, and act as though their products could not possibly have any problems. You must argue and return multiple times to convince them that your issue is real, not your fault, and should be rightfully resolved under warranty - which you purchased! \n\nPerhaps the problem extends beyond just this store. Perhaps it is Apple altogether that has lost the elements that used to justify the excessive premium of owning and using their products. \n\nBut I'll say this much. If you work at this store, especially as a manager, you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself. You should look yourself in the mirror and know that you are a part of a team of cheaters and liars who leverage a powerful brand to take advantage of consumers. You may not even realize it, but every single day you are disappointing and hurting people who are trusting you. Not to mention, failing the once storied Apple brand. \n\nSteve Jobs would fire the entire staff if he observed even one interaction I've had at this store over the past two years. And it's not just me. I observe the same treatment to mothers, elders, teenagers, everyone. \n\nI sold all 300 of my Apple shares before writing this review on Yelp, because I just don't believe this company cares anymore. And that, above all, is the one thing that keeps customers coming back. \n\nIf you work at this store, look in the mirror and ask yourself, \"am I not better than this?\" -- then, quit.</td></tr><tr><td>jlTB1Qc4qbx1YRpuHeNgcg</td><td>-1</td><td>Absolutely the worst food -- not just Chinese food, but food in general -- I have ever had delivered in my entire life!

He is always so rude when I ask him to scan it. He's doing nothing, the place is empty, and he just expects you to leave a package there without it being scanned into the system. It's like leaving cash with someone without a receipt. Sometimes these packages are worth thousands of dollars -- it is YOUR JOB at UPS to accept the package for the customer. \n\nIt's a very simple job, and it's incredibly self-centered and rude to hassle customers when they ask you to scan pre-paid packages. \n\nI left a package worth $450 with him and the vendor has yet to receive it. He refused to scan it while I was in front of him. Now I'm nervous that it will never get there. \n\nThere's something about him I don't trust, and this is the last straw. Avoid this UPS.

I made a reservation a couple of days in advance for a table for 2 at 10:30 a.m. After reading about how busy this place gets on Sunday, I was glad we did. We entered through the casino and received assistance in locating the hostess who was located near the front main entrance off the strip. The casino entrance looks legit but the official entrance is actually from the exterior. \n\nThis restaurant is HUGE! There are several rooms, each with its own unique feel - some airy and sunlit - others more dim, ensuring a more intimate mood. With a plethora of seating options inside, and a highly sought patio-arrangement, HEXX is Modernly decorated, ultra trendy, and THE hotspot for Sunday brunch. 'Nuff said about the venue itself...on to the rest: The reason you are spending money! \n\nSERVICE: 4/5 Stars\nOur server was friendly and helpful enough, but she managed to disappear for upwards of 15 minutes toward the end of our meal experience. I was desperate for one last mimosa and my friend just wanted to obtain our check - so we had to ask a nearby busser to come to our rescue.\n\nBRUNCH FOOD: 5/5 Stars\nYES TO ALL THINGS FOOD. \nWe were sold on the Carrot Cake pancakes after seeing the pictures on Yelp. Our Carrot Cake pancakes didn't quite resemble the modelesque photos, as they seemed to be missing some of the topping ingredients...either way, the pancakes were LEGIT. You could literally see the shredded carrots on the bottom of each pancake. Basically if you want dessert for breakfast, this dish is for you. We shared them and could barely finish the plate. \n\nSteak and Eggs - I ordered my New York Strip medium rare, eggs scrambled. Just do it and don't look back. This dish is also accompanied by yummy skillet potatoes and a fluffy English muffin.\n\nMy friend had the Farm Fresh Eggs and she reports that this dish was just what the doctor ordered. She ordered her eggs cooked over-medium and that they were cooked perfectly - a hard task to achieve apparently. And the bacon was perfectly crispy...YES!\n\nBRUNCH BEVERAGES: 3/5\nI had better mimosas when I gambled at Planet Hollywood. For $23 per person, you can add bottomless mimosas to your meal, or you can just skip the meal and pay the $23 for unlimited mimosas. They come pre-mixed with O.J.  Meaning, each glass consists mostly of OJ, which you have to guzzle through in order to the next one. \n\nThey do not have any other flavors, but when I inquired about changing up the flavor, our server said she could add Peach Puree for an extra $6.00 and basically give me the bottle to make my own mimosas. I upgraded to the $29 but I never got to make my own mimosas. She brought me a glass of potent peach puree already pre-mixed with champagne. I poured most of it out and ask for a top-off of just champagne. We never had the bottle on our table and we barely got them to approach the table with it.  \n\nIf you are looking for awesome food at a trendy Vegas-central location, choose HEXX (but be sure to make a reservation). If you are looking for delicious mimosas and decent food, hit up the Bellagio Buffet. You'll spend a bit more money, but you'll enjoy unlimited food and potentially have 100% access to the champagne (so long as nothing has changed since I was last there in 2013).</td></tr><tr><td>lhXvqpQRa3lbIKZ-TigtVw</td><td>-1</td><td>I purchased tickets for a Wednesday night show featuring comedians Rich Vos, B.T. & Matt Holt. There are a couple of reasons for the 5 star rating tied to this review. \n\n1. A HILARIOUS group of comics (which is a must, right)? We actually had no idea who any of the performers were when we decided on this comedy show. To be perfectly honest, it was our last official night in Vegas so I was on a relatively tight budget after gambling much of my money away. So my thought process was: Whatever's the cheapest, put us on the list. We were pleasantly surprised with the variety of jokes and entertainment factor.\n\n2. Big props to Brad Garrett's staff for turning our night into one that we will never forget. The tickets I originally purchased were in the cheapest tier so our seats were way in the back. We opted for bar stools so that we could see over everyone's heads. I expressed interest in any other seats that opened up and the hostess politely said that these seats were all they had. Now I don't know if a Yelp check-in/picture post made any kind of difference or if the comedians have some kind of say, but 1 minute before the show began, a gentleman working in the comedy club came up to us to say that he had two seats up front open up and asked if we would like to move. I didn't even consult my friend, I just said, \"Abso-freakin'-lutely, let's go!\" \n\nThese two seats ended up being the two directly IN FRONT of the microphone. This fact made us easy targets for the performers but we are good sports and didn't mind at all.  We were able to view the show from an angle/perspective that we wouldn't have ever experienced if it had not been for Brad Garrett's courteous and mindful staff. AND we scored some awesome free pizza out of it since the comedian made promises on-stage that he was forced to keep. It was a night we will never forget -and for that - 5 stars for Brad Garrett's Comedy Club!</td></tr><tr><td>x7bPVux5qpuEReln54pmLA</td><td>-1</td><td>Very poor service and the store front/ setting area is a mess.

Their sign mentioned \"owned by real Mexicans\" but when my real Mexican mother asked a woman a question in Spanish( yes this is America I get it) she acted like she didn't understand and responded in broken English. Aside from below average customer experience the food was cold and not acceptable for consumption. Since when are quesadillas served cold? All the plates were cold and the presentation could have been better assembled by the 1 year old in our party. The container park is catered to families and this establishment better think twice of they want to increase revenue.

Many of them have been quite negative recently, but that appears to be changing. Well, I'm one of them who is trending upward, as I just ate here for my first time and I loved it! Understand that this is NOT the same Chef who was here when Guy Fieri came.\n\nFirst, I love a good juicy burger. I haven't had a ton of them here in Charlotte, but yes, there are a few (Liberty, Bernardins, Halcyon, etc.). I purposefully came well after lunch to avoid that crowd. The menu was simple, so I chose the mushroom swiss burger. Being a big guy and a burger lover, I ordered a double for $2.00 more. I asked for the Onion Rings as my side.\n\nWell, the burger was big, and very juicy! A lot of burger places grill them to \"depleted uranium\" doneness. Not here. It was medium to medium well, a discernible pink in the middle. Good toppings and nice bun. Overall a really good burger!\n\nBut I can't say the same about their Onion Rings. I don't know what it is here in Charlotte. It seems that too many places Onion Rings are just plain flower with some seasoning, which makes for a flat, dry Onion Ring. I'd like to see more soda water batter. Their \"Penguin Sauce\" for the Rings was good.....almost like a milder Cholulu sauce. But the Rings need work guys!\n\nThe wait staff was good, and the Manager (maybe Owner?) was there to greet and say goodbye and thank you. \n\nOverall I really liked the Penguin!

REALLY! Anyway, this time I went all out....getting the \"classic\" French fares of Escargot, French Onion Soup, a classic Fromage (cheese) dish as appetizers. He got a traditional Brie-stuffed Half-Chicken, herb roasted. I got Bistro-style Steak Frites. Desserts included Creme BrÃ»le (Again, he's NEVER had it) and a Southern classic of Bread Pudding (with the French flair of caramel drizzle). \n\nSuffice it to say it was all OUTSTANDING. My buddy said it was in his TOP 5 best dinners of all time (he's only 30 and just got out of college so top end restaurants was never in his sights)! Great atmosphere, service, quality, and very, VERY reasonable in price!\n\nThis time around....5 Stars!\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nWent here based upon my Yelp buddy Nicole, and she was right, again! With my wife being French Canadian, it's hard to live up to the standards and expectations of her native Montreal, who obviously serves fantastic French fare.\n\nSo we go here after seeing Jersey Boys (FANTASTIQUE!) and started off with the seared Fois Gras. Now REAL Fois Gras IS expensive, and this little appetizer set us back $18. But it WAS worth it as the Fois Gras was creamy, succulent and utterly delicious as it was accompanied by crispy fennel, onions and mushrooms. Not to be outdone, we ordered the Ahi Tuna tartare appetizer special also, and that too did not disappoint.\n\nAll the entrees looked fabulous, and my wife chose their \"famous\" stuffed chicken with brie (the official name escapes me), and I had the bone-in port chop. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of the bitter kale veggie, but this one was seared with pancetta and it was very delicious! I surmise that they also did something \"special\" to the kale to take away its bitterness. But the \"piece de resistance\" was the crispy pork belly accompanying my pork chop. This is a hit or miss dish, and thankfully, here at Lulu, it was a BIG HIT! Very yummy! My wife LOVED the stuffed chicken too!\n\nDessert brought us a dual (milk and dark) chocolate mousse and a pear tart. The pear tart was the only \"disappointment\" of the evening as we were expecting something more than a piece of pear on top of an almond cake. But hey, it was at least tasty, but they could have done better with it.\n\nHad 2 dessert wines as well to accompany our sweet delights. Since we brought our own wine, their $15 corkage was most reasonable.\n\nAll in all, this is a really good restaurant. I'd say it's comparable to Cafe Monte, perhaps a little more refined and more authentically French Bistro. But both are good.\n\nJust be careful about the parking! Do NOT park in the VFW lot next door or you care will be towed.\n\nCan't wait to go back!</td></tr><tr><td>-ZEnmNBazo8E1u5FfGZkEg</td><td>-1</td><td>Had the hippie burger. It was decent... not the best, not the worst. Normal black bean veggie burger not very much seasoning 13$ comes with a side.

Awesome food. And then the lamb biryani was pretty good, and just as we started to enjoy the food, the experience started going downhill. \n\nFirst the dal makhni. Was as bland as you can get. No salt, no spices, no whatsoever spices, despite asking for a spice rating of 7/10 for the dal.\nMistake no.1 forgiven. \nOrdered a paratha(a bread) and as we were eating it, we find a piece of polythene cooked along with the bread. Disgusting. We mentioned that to the waitress and she apologises and tries to talk to the chef. Apparently the chef has disappeared, so she tells the manager, who cares two hoots about our complaint. Is this how you'd treat a customer? \nThis attitude of the restaurant's management is absolutely shocking and I have to admit that though some of the dishes at the restaurant are absolutely fantastic, the service is absolutely pathetic and deplorable. It ruins the whole experience of eating out in a restaurant. \nCoupled with the sad devil may care attitude of the management, I'm afraid that I will not be going back to this place any time soon. \n\nFor a restaurant that has opened up recently and looking for patronage from customers, I'm sorry to say that, they are horrible. \nI wish they would atleast learn to respect a customer and acknowledge their mistakes.</td></tr><tr><td>vA3yaVp_HveAEZTcIQdHHQ</td><td>-1</td><td>Food is normally good.

We were a party of 19. Eventually they agreed on the condition that I would have no less than 15 people. Service was horrible. Waiter kept complaining that he was the only one and could not handle a simple tasklike wiping spilled water off the floor, we had a few small children and I was very concerned of them falling on the wet floor. He was obviously having a bad day, but did not need to take it on us. Quality of food was decent for the price, but service spoiled our birthday. They ended up charging us for unfinished plate of sushi which I think was ridiculous but I paid them anyways. Overall disappointing day</td></tr><tr><td>kZAuEq88ZQlIgBsHim85Hg</td><td>-1</td><td>I just called the Danforth Store to request them to get some balloons ready for me which I was going to pick-up in the next 15 to 20 minutes.  The lady informed me that they would do this when I arrived so I asked her again because I cannot wait.  Last time I went in for balloons I waited for twenty minutes because of other customers that were ahead of me.  I also had to park illegally because there were no spots available anywhere close by, so I was really sweating it when the woman ahead of me was asking the salesperson a million questions.  As far as I'm concerned I'll never go to this place again because they cannot accommodate such a simple request.  If they're so scared someone won't show for the balloons, then why wouldn't they take a credit card.  I have balloons here that I'll blow up myself and save  almost $30.</td></tr><tr><td>KMXDV2nnKPUHh045l1o8Ng</td><td>-1</td><td>Will never visit this establishment again. I made a special trip there on Saturday August 15th around 3:30. There was a lady already there being served and another customer waiting at the counter. There was no greeting or communication that we will get to you soon.\n\nThe lady being served was ordering a ton of  items and had never ending questions about items in the showcase. This went on for quite awhile and I just got disgusted and left because there was another staff person there who was aware there were two other customers waiting.  This second staff person was at the front counter when I arrived but took off to the back food counter and busied herself there.\n\nIt's nice to know customers are not your top priority.  This was my first and last visit here ever.   There are many other excellent bakeries where I am not subjected to this type of neglectful customer service.</td></tr><tr><td>JZZAnaAWLYmqUqMNHgP5Xw</td><td>-1</td><td>This place has dirty tables, dirty windows, and absolutely filthy washrooms.

One room with two queen beds was ready but the other room with the king bed wasn't ready for another 2 hours. We left and went to walk the strip. I received a text saying my room was ready. When I got back to the hotel they said our room wasn't ready unless we wanted a different room and not the connected room. It was 340 pm at this point. They told us it would be another hour or more for the room to be ready. We called downstairs at 430 and asked about the room. Still not ready. We asked for a discount on the room since it wasn't ready when regular check in time is 3 pm. They wouldn't give us a discount but offered $50 in food and drink credit. We already had a $35 credit in food and drink from booking the room through hotels.com. We wanted to make sure the $50 was on top of the $35 credit. They told us it was not. But we were able to correct that. So we had $85 in credit. Then we received a call and they said our room was ready and they programmed the key cards we had for the connected room. They said to try our cards to see if it would work. It did not work. So they ran up a new pair of cards. Then they told us that the room was clean this whole time and that the housekeeper had forgotten to update that the room was clean. Also, we told them not to clean our hotel room and to give us a do not disturb sign. When we came back to the room it had been cleaned. This hotel is horrible. They do not communicate with each other. I would not recommend this hotel. I will never come back here ever again. \n\nThe shower was nice. There was strong water pressure and lots of hot water. Also, no fridge unless you want to pay $25 a night. And there is no microwave. Cheaper hotels offer fridges at no charge.</td></tr><tr><td>MFenDL-3rS9i7RXo3lrW5g</td><td>-1</td><td>I have went to this location for years due to it being close to my house. I have had my share of issues with it but never really complained. There was a time i ordered a sausage biscuit and there was no meat on the biscuit, i came back when i was able to and the lady looked at me like i was nuts. But anyway i went last week to that Mcdonalds and they got my order wrong and gave my sweet tea with a hole in the cup. That sandwich they have me was burnt as well. And og course like a fool, i go back today and they took my order correct but still gave me something i didn't ask for. So needless to say, that location will not be getting my business any time soon.</td></tr><tr><td>s8KfVTDiqOrZtyss4YF8MA</td><td>-1</td><td>I've eaten at Bar Louie, a number of times.  I live closest to the one in Legacy Village, work near the one on West 6th and have also visited the one in Columbus.  I've never had a bad meal or experience at Bar Louie.\n\nIf I go for lunch, which I did before this review, I normallly get the hummus, tabouleh small plate, which is a huge portion for $8 and comes with sliced cucumbers, warm flatbread and yogurt sauce.   On this visit, I noticed from the menu that the tabouleh has been replaced with tapenade....didn't really have a taste for olives, so I ordered the turkey, ham and brie sandwich accompanied by tater tots.  The sandwich arrived on a french sub roll that had been sliced and toasted inside out (a bit strange, and also made for a really crunchy sandwich).  There were generous portions of thick sliced turkey & ham and nice slices of brie, accompanied by a blackberry jam spread.  The tater tots were standard frozen variety.   All in all this was a pretty decent meal, but will stick to some of my other favorites, going forward.</td></tr><tr><td>eeTO3yaxkvVyMHGrWhUg-Q</td><td>-1</td><td>I've worked downtown for almost 20 years and have seen the Colonial Arcade go thru many changes. I've walked past this restaurant more times than I can count and just never stopped in.  Earlier this week, the weather was nice and I was looking to get away from office, not looking for anything fancy for lunch just a simple salad or sandwich.  I immediately thought of this place based on having read a Yelp review.  I stopped in just prior to noon. The place was clean/tidy and the staff was very friendly. There were a few patrons that I could tell were regulars based on their conversations with the staff.   I was immediately seated and greeted by the waitress.  I decided to order the chicken salad platter.   The platter arrived shortly thereafter, nothing fancy, but everything was fresh.  A nice scoop of homemade white meat chicken salad, on top of iceberg lettuce leaves, surrounded by 3 tomato slices, a sliced hardboiled egg and a few dill pickle slices.  I also requested saltine crackers to accompany the meal.  All-in-all this was an OK meal, not extraordinary, but fit the bill based on what I had a taste for that day.  My total with tax , was just under $6, therefore this was definitely a deal.   I'll return to try some of the other menu items.</td></tr><tr><td>qhkn_07JPaRMBinJ7KNeYQ</td><td>-1</td><td>Overall, I would give this place a 3.5.  This lunch visit was more of a 3, but all in all price, portion and value are pretty decent here.   I've been here many times, can't believe that I haven't posted a review before now.  I've never had dinner here, and according to other Yelpers, I probably shouldn't plan to.  There is usually a pretty decent crowd at lunch.  Today, I ordered the Angel Hair pasta with tomatoes, basil and chicken in garlic and olive oil ($12).  The entree included fresh italian bread with a side of garlic butter (nice touch) and a small side salad which I had with the house balsamic dressing.   The entree today, was just ok.  It was a little bit murky in color and a bit clumpy in texture and taste.   It was decent, just not as good as previous visits.   My dining companion ordered the Chicken Piccatta and she was very pleased.  Overall you can't beat the portions and price.  I will definitely return.....for lunch:-)</td></tr><tr><td>IUQNmPIf80FrTikeKZeqhg</td><td>-1</td><td>I have eaten here a few times in the past, but never got around to posting a review.  I ventured here on yesterday for lunch, looking for something fresh & light.   I opted for the hummus wrap with a side of tabouli.  First of all you can't beat the prices here.  My hummus wrap was  $3 and the generous side of tabouli was only $2.75.  The wrap was perfect.   The pita bread was soft and fresh, the veggies (lettuce, tomatoes etc), were cool and fresh and the hummus was creamy and garlicky, just they way that I like it.   The tabouli was very fresh, but just ok, way too many onions for me.  All in all this was a good meal, especially for the low, low price of $5.75!</td></tr><tr><td>WIg3mu1UUDXqs1yKwPFzgQ</td><td>-1</td><td>This was my second time at Banana Blossom and each visit was enjoyable.  On this visit, I went with a co-worker who had never had Pad Thai (what!), so of course we had to get that and we also ordered the House Fried Rice, just in case she didn't like the Pad Thai (I know, I know....what's not to like).  We also ordered the spring rolls, as a starter.   The spring rolls arrived hot, crisp and fresh with a side of dipping sauce.  The entrees arrived shortly thereafter and needless to say....my co-worker LOVED the Pad Thai.   We eagerly shared both dishes, eating until we were beyond full and satisfied.</td></tr><tr><td>1KRUFFsBKQYIKODUk-h1uQ</td><td>-1</td><td>I've been wanting to try V's since reading the write-up in Scene Magazine and reading the Yelp reviews.  This place is less than 15 minutes from home and is in such an unassuming location, I probably would never have stopped had I not seen the rave reviews.  I decided to have V's for Sunday dinner.  I called in my order, as the on-line menu recommends.  I was told that the order would be ready in approx. 30 minutes, so I timed my arrival accordingly.  The wait was a bit longer than promised, but no complaints, because the food is definitely worth the wait.  I ordered the 8 piece family meal.  8 pieces of chicken (2 of each piece), 2 large sides (I ordered mashed potatoes & gravy, corn and an extra large side of mac n cheese, and a small side of rice & greens). The meal also comes with your choice of bread.  I opted for the honey biscuits.   As other Yelp reviewers have commented, the chicken is AWESOME!   There are a number of options for coating, I chose the seasoned which was tasty.  The chicken was tender, juicy and the outer crust was crunchy and flavorful.  There was nothing that I didn't like about the chicken, and it was very evident that it had been cooked to order.  The sides were average to above average, although I did really enjoy the rice & greens, nice flavor combination.  The honey biscuits....OMG, warm, fluffy biscuits, drizzled in honey.  The biscuits were more like dessert, very tasty.   My total bill was $28.00, and I have a boatload of leftovers, for another meal.   I'll definitely return to V's.....soon!</td></tr><tr><td>8tLTR772nzT62v_3IRNvLw</td><td>-1</td><td>I was treated unfairly because I was retrieving boxes on the 4th shelf (easily because I'm tall) to move minding my own business, and a worker by the name of Kiana came over and said \"You are not supposed to get things near the top shelf it messes with our numbers\" in a rude, annoyed attitude that I did not desurve and sent me to the back of the store because they are SO worried about their reputation and their safety numbers, so instead of getting my individual boxes on my own (because I only needed 5 boxes) and instead I had to get two four packs of boxes and now I have 8 boxes and 3 extra that I have no use for. I believe Office Max should fix their form of customer care and learn differant ways to react to a situation like this, like answering \"Can I help\" or \" Can I help you today?\" because I do NOT think someone should ever recive such bad and rude attitude for such an innocent thing. This is one of the worst service I have ever had. I hope that Office Max will fix this soon</td></tr><tr><td>FOLzJXMohXMogvW5nNbRag</td><td>-1</td><td>I'm not sure if I'll be back. My husband and I ordered 2 burgers and 2 sodas. My food arrived cold, we kept having to ask for drink refills, and when the check came it was $66?!? Luckily, my husband reviewed the bill before simply paying it. We were charged for extra drinks and burgers we never ordered. The bill ended being half the amount after we questioned it. Our server was hard to track down when my food arrived with mistakes. I asked to add mayo to my burger and had to wait for my already cold food to be taken back and fixed. The food was good (after it was fixed), but the service was questionable. Maybe next time I'll just do take out instead.</td></tr><tr><td>o3RTpNnE_gO-dz4LKkxjVg</td><td>-1</td><td>Very nice atmosphere and the food is very good; margaritas are amazing.

Our waitress would disappear for long periods of time. We ordered the Trio appetizer and one was correct but the other was missing 2 items, which we had to point out to our waitress. It took 25 minutes to get a beer order and 30 minutes for our food to come out. The waitress even admitted that we were her only table and that she should be more on top of things. It will be a while before we return.</td></tr><tr><td>rCfBx-L6583UWrBY5tDDFA</td><td>-1</td><td>We just had dinner there and while the food was very good, and the chef entertaining, the service was lacking. We were there for around 45 minutes before a chef came to our table to prepare our food. With 2 small children in your party that can be an eternity. Our waitress never refilled, or offered to refill, my water the entire time. It also took a long time get the bill taken care of. Hopefully these are issues that will be resolved as the restaurant has been around for a while.</td></tr><tr><td>2cTdmpgq0rW2rSgrTGtLOw</td><td>-1</td><td>Have to agree other reviewers, typical Wendy's food but every time we visit the service is extremely slow.

As others had mentioned, they only wanted to come if my husband was going to be here. After sitting through a lengthy presentation about the \"quality\" of their doors (which lasted about an hour) we were finally given a price of over $9,000 for 2 doors. When we said absolutely not he lowered the price to $7,600-really?? We would never do business with a company that operates like this. Plus, I couldn't get the exact door I want. I can get the exact door I want in wood for less than half the price. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because the sales guy was really nice.</td></tr><tr><td>VgUFtjqTtoa21bayQFNAGg</td><td>-1</td><td>Connected with wifi but the wifi basically not functioning.

The service was laughable. I mean truly horrible. Seems to be a common issue from reading other reviews at this location. Two waitresses literally argued right Infront of us (tossing insults back and forth over us, as we sat down actually) about who's job it was to wipe our table. Once they figured that out, the girl who actually did it, complained to us that it wasn't even that dirty and she shouldn't be asked to clean it. It was truly bizarre.  Then three different people came over to take drink/food orders after we had already ordered. Clearly a lack of organization and leadership. There are so many people looking for work these days, they really need to re-evaluate who they have in this location interacting with customers.</td></tr><tr><td>YSmlpoByXMkpOfN_cGXBNQ</td><td>-1</td><td>I love this spot. One of my favorites for years. They recently made some changes to the menu and everything was fantastic. I've never gone to this location for the food but I do now. Loved everything. The carne asada street tacos were unique and some of the best I've had.  This is also by far the best day drinking chill spot I've found. I never have a bad time here\n\nOnly reason to not get five stars is I think their struggling a bit with the staff. There seems to be a high turnover and usually only 1 person during the week tending bar and waiting tables. Makes for slow service.  We've noticed it's gotten a lot slower overall in there lately. Really hope it comes back around for them. It's a great spot.</td></tr><tr><td>XFeoqCrQ3WRHxN9_IuOIVw</td><td>-1</td><td>So glad Guedos has reopened in Gilbert.

A girl called me shortly after to let me know the dishwasher was out of stock and asked if I wanted to order it or cancel and take my chances at another store. I asked her when the dishwasher would be restocked. She said she had no idea and it could be weeks. She seemed annoyed by my question and offered me no help in finding one at a nearby store or finding out when more would be shipped from their warehouse. At this point we get disconnected before we discussed how to move forward. Instead of calling me back this woman just went ahead and cancelled my ENTIRE order without my knowledge or consent. She did not attempt to call me back. No one notified me that order for the refrigerator that was in stock that I ordered and the out of stock dishwasher were completely cancelled \n\nThe only way I even found this out, was because after about an hour of waiting for a call back, I decided to call THEM. After about 20 minutes on hold and being shuffled between departments I end up on the phone with another person in appliances, who was so unprofessional in her language and not at all helpful. She looked up my order and said she wasn't sure how I wanted her to help me. She literally said the words \"I have no idea how to help you\" she had me transferred again, while she went to talk to someone \"up front\", to see if my card had been charged for the order they cancelled (it had) before I got a resolution to this, I was hung up on AGAIN. \n\nOnce again, no call back. Mind you they had my order right Infront of them both times with all my contact info on it. I called back AGAIN and got the same rude and unhelpful lady in appliances. She told me she DID NOT HAVE TIME TO HELP ME. She was in the middle of a sale. She would try to have somebody call me back later. My mind was totally blown. I understand if you're busy, but at this point your store has so totally screwed this, don't tell me you don't have TIME for me because you're making a sale. Apologize and tell me you will look into it deeper and call me back. \n\nAt this point I called back again and asked for a manager and cancelled my order and went elsewhere. Hopefully the charge will be refunded in 24 hours like she assured me it would. I'm giving two stars because I like lowes overall, but this store is an absolute mess with untrained and rude employees</td></tr><tr><td>hsYrElTkRoHEA_GKqgDVLw</td><td>-1</td><td>Love this location.

It's the first time I've seen people collide and drop props in the show.  Even the centre piece started to fall apart and one of the avatars tried pushing it back on.\nThe show was a ton of blue guys with tails running around.

Appreciate the tiny free waters x2/day. Late check out is not complimentary, unfortunately. $20 for an extra hour, $40 for an extra 3 hours. Glad they have the option but never been asked to pay. Another inconvenience here is the gym. I love getting a good workout in to start the day. None of the 3 elliptical machines functioned properly. They have old and useless iPhone 4 connectors circa 2010, the TV volume is out on 2 machines (no matter which headphones are used, theirs or mine), the picture/tv monitor is out on the 3rd, and 2 of 3 machines shake when in use. Not only should Vdara be testing their equipment regularly, but updating as well. You'd think they'd offer free extended check out to make up for it.

They harassed me at least 5 times on a yearly basis to rentals I had, and trying deeply hard to take money from your pocket for fault not made by myself but other Zipsters / strangers. If you eventually find sufficient proof to show them you are innocent and upset, then they gave you a verbal sorry and that is it, easy than anything. And expect harassments and taking more and more money from your credit card account without giving you sufficent proof. You want to fight for it? It took days, your patience, and your mood as well.\n\nOverall their nonprofessional practices and sneaky customer experience have outweighed the convenience they provided.

Please don't call the Police on me....\n\nVery funky hippie/bohemian vibe in this place.....I was half expecting to get the Washington/Colorado treatment if you know what I mean....Uh hem. While I'm quite sure that NOBODY in this place is from my political side of the aisle, this IS a cool place to enjoy some beer or wine on the patio, and enjoy a deli sandwich (during the day anyway). \n\nWhat I was really blown away with was their really stellar wine and beer selection! Who would have thunk that such a small, funky place would carry such \"hard to find\" wine and beer selections! As \"the Wineguy,\" I was shocked to see many Oregon Pinot Noirs, some \"boutique\" Zinfandels, and even a Beaujolais Blanc! Not exactly a common wine....but apparently it is in the COMMON market!\n\nBecause I need more wine like a hole in the head, I left with a couple of bottles of Mexican Coke! (Uh, the SOFT drink......) Now for those of you in my age bracket (yes I'm old), this is how Coke USED to make their product....with CANE sugar! Now they use High Fructose Corn Syrup which while not bad (and CERTAINLY better than that sweet a$$ Pepsi), pure cane sugar ROCKS! So I bought both and there IS a taste difference! The Mexicans got it right folks.....Pure Cane Sugar WINS! WOO HOO!\n\nOverall you just can't help but like this place......the guy behind the beer bar was cranky, but hey, it was late on a Monday night and I would have been cranky too. \n\nI do look forward to going back here....this time during the day OR when I decide to hit the Food Truck Rally!</td></tr><tr><td>Ss8-_Cc4MTImye5QBaiErQ</td><td>-1</td><td>For a national chain, this one is pretty good. Certainly NOT the lowest prices in the world, but they do carry a very wide variety of products. I happen to have a Mountain Lion masquerading as a cat, so I have to buy more litter than the average cat owner (big stinker!). And since he's eating me out of house and home, I tend to switch up on his dry cat food which they carry PLENTY of. In fact, sometimes I've overwhelmed with the choices! But I guess that's better than not enough, huh?\n\nSo this really is my go to store for pet products. \n\nOH....my TIP: STAY AWAY FROM THE ADOPTION CENTER!!!!!!!!! Trust me, you'll want to take one (or more) HOME! Soooooooo many kitties needing homes....I wish I could take one but my Mountain Lion wouldn't accept that....he's too old for a new brother or sister. \n\nREVISED TIP: GO TO THE ADOPTION CENTER IF YOU HAVE THE HEART TO RESCUE A SWEET LITTLE KITTY!</td></tr><tr><td>wZdXOvEhscZLJ_K1LYEb-A</td><td>-1</td><td>I know this is a very popular local dive, but to me it's just an OK or \"Meh\" bar.

I reluctantly had the work done as it was mid winter and I could not do the work myself. I figured at least the breaks will be like new. \n  In short, it was one of the worst decisions I ever made... the breaks don't seem much better than before and we now have a thumping sound from the front end when turning?

She is so patient, detail-oriented, and focused. First, she asked me about my skin, whether it was sensitive, prone to breaking out, etc. Then she prepared my skin for the wax. She asked me how I typically like my eyebrows to look. She completed the procedure in a detailed, but fairly painless way. I've never had such a painless wax/tweezing in my life. After putting on some calming lotion, she handed me a mirror and asked me what  I thought. I was really happy with the results. The salon is well-priced as well. I am definitely going back.</td></tr><tr><td>ua1C9O1A5LLJlkNlR6TI5Q</td><td>-1</td><td>My cousins from Australia were in town and we were trying to come up with something fun to spend the evening doing. Then I remembered that The Rec Room had opened recently and thought it might be a fun night out. \n\nWe each bought 30 dollars worth of \"tokens\" (which are added to a digital bracelet so you're not actually lugging any physical tokens around, how times have changed!) and were told that it would probably last us about two hours. Spoiler alert: it did. In fact, I was trying to find ways to use up my tokens by the end (the Photo Booth was a good way to use them up). \n\nWhich brings me to one of the bigger downsides: the lack of variety. Yes, it was super fun to get to play the arcade games, but the fact is there really aren't *that* many to choose from, and after the first hour you're kind of grasping for ways to kill tokens.\n\nThe types of games are basically split into two categories: skill games that give you \"tickets\" that you can redeem for prizes (think Ski-Ball, Hoops shooting, etc.) and pure arcade games that do not result in tickets (your Alien shooters, your racing games, etc.). There's also a \"third\" tier which are the \"jackpot\" type \"games\" which are really nothing more than you feeding tokens in hope that you hit the jackpot and win a bunch of tickets. It *can* be done - my one cousin ended up scoring almost 500 on one \"spin the wheel\" game - but chances are you're just going to burn a bunch of tokens real quick. \n\nIn other words, with most games costing between 6-8 tokens you could be hard pressed to actually spend them all and not get tired of playing the same few games over and over again. \n\nThere's also some pinball machines (including a beautiful Ghostbusters themed one) and in the back traditional bar games (like pool, though we didn't try these out). There's also a VR experience called \"THE VOID\" which costs ~$30 extra and requires a reservation but we didn't try it out. It looked cool, but I can't imagine it's worth the huge added cost. To be honest, the place is so huge there might have been more stuff we were missing, but it seemed that the arcade games were in one main, rather smallish section.\n\nWhile $30/person isn't the most expensive night out, things could definitely be improved by adding a larger variety of games, and more of them. But in terms of a fun night out with out-of-towners, it was a big success.\n\nThey also have a restaurant called three10 which we had dinner at before digging into the games. It offers your standard sort of \"bar & grill\" fare (think burgers, steaks, wraps, etc). The food itself isn't great, and you're definitely paying a premium. For three people (including drinks) our bill was over $100 and you can easily get a *much* better meal for less in the city, so you're better to stick to just the games here, and avoid the food. Though the Popcorn appetizer (this is a Cineplex owned joint after all) was a nice touch!</td></tr><tr><td>6JjAWzbTrSNdNDGoogMjMg</td><td>-1</td><td>A friend of mine came here for a quick bite to eat before heading to the theatre. We were both struck by the decoration. It has this lovely Japanese garden feel which was very unexpected and very charming. As for the food? It was very tasty. The fish was fresh, and they sure don't skimp on the spicy sauce. Value for money is pretty good too considering a King Street restaurant.\n\nThe only disappointment was that they were completely out of red wine, which was unfortunate. They also never checked to see if we had theatre tickets and were in a rush (thankfully we came early enough that we weren't), which seemed odd considering most other restaurants in the area do, but thankfully the restaurant wasn't too busy and we had plenty of time.\n\nI definitely would come back again.</td></tr><tr><td>lnkFh6etlNK6ahY3gHM3Vw</td><td>-1</td><td>If I could give this place NO STARS I would.

Last night, for my 60th birthday I suggested to my friends that we hit the American Tavern, as in the past their clambakes, offered in October, were fabulous! This is definitely not the same restaurant.They too offered the clambake. We arrived relatively early, 5:30,sat at the bar and had a cocktail. We then asked to be seated. There was a large table in back open,but we were told it was reserved. I had called earlier in the week to inquire if they took reservations and was told only for parties of 8 or larger, but that I shouldn't worry, that I should stilll be able to be accommodated at 6:00. We were packed into a 4 top with a chair added at the end. The larger table earlier requested, ended up being dismantled and not used...Wait. it gets better...After about 10 min. the server came over in a frantic mode, and asked to take our order. We were prepared but felt he was really put out when we wanted to place a drink order. One couple ordered sandwiches, and we three ordered the advertised clambake. We did not receive our drinks for about 15 minutes. We sat and waited for 40 minutes for the food to be brought out. By this time , about 4 tables had got up and walked out. When the food starting with the barely warm clam chowder came out, we still did not have silverware on our table! The sandwiches were brought out, and they did look nice. We were then brought out plates with corn on the cobb, sweet potato, (undercooked),my charred black chicken,(which I had to scrape to eat,but the burnt flavor went through the meat, and two tough steaks that both had been prepared wrong.(one was over cooked, the other too rare.) Then apparently as dessert, the clams were brought out.The clams were the best part of the meal, and fairly, the couple with the sandwiches said that they were good. In total we waited 1.5 hrs for our meal. No apology from the manager, not even so much as comping us a round of drinks. Terrible service, and terrible food.</td></tr><tr><td>v3JJo6u3438Sh4xMbfca-w</td><td>-1</td><td>Worst hotel ever! Picture a crack house with a receptionist.

I had a taste for a good Italian sandwich, so I stopped in on a late Saturday morning to pick up sandwiches for lunch.   The staff was super-friendly.   I ordered to Italian subs, one with hot peppers and one without.  Each sandwich was just a little bit over $4, what a deal.   I also ordered antipasto salad and pasta salad as side dishes to accompany the sandwiches.    I arrived home and my husband and I proceeded to dig in.   The sandwiches included a fresh, hard italian roll with plenty of italian meat, provolone cheese and a nice mix of hot peppers dressed in an italian dressing.  The salads were also fresh and tasty.   The only downside is that they don't take debit/credit cards, so its  good thing that I did have cash.   I will definitely return.</td></tr><tr><td>qsPRAYtOZfuSxOGJ9uDVxA</td><td>-1</td><td>I am a Pho fan, and ecstatic that a place opened closer to where I live.  I have to be honest, Superior Pho is my favorite, with Pho Thang running a close second.  Sugar Bowl, however was pretty tasty.  I ventured in on a Friday night, greeted warmly by the counter-person.  I am not a huge fan of ordering at the counter and then being seated, but the process was easy enough.  I ordered Pho Tai and spring rolls, and then found a counter seat in front of the window.  The spring rolls arrived a short time later, nothing extraordinary.  Order of 4 cooked to order ($4.95).  I would suggest offering a 1/2 order for those dining alone.  The Pho took a bit longer than I would have expected, medium bowl, lots of noodles, decent amount of broth.  I added thai basil, jalapenos, beans sprouts, hoisin and sriracha, and the soup was still a bit bland.  I added a bit more hoisin and sriracha, which improved the taste.  The serving was generous and the soup was piping hot.  I truly enjoyed my soup, once seasoned to my liking.  The only downside for me, was the seating was not that comfortable, but that wouldn't stop me from returning.....soon.</td></tr><tr><td>24Zn1kuMAupn-qQyXEhD5w</td><td>-1</td><td>I've wanted to visit Hash House A Go Go, during my travel to other cities, but never had the time to squeeze in a visit.  On my trip to Vegas, decided to try this place, to see what the buzz was all about.  My husband and I visited on a Wednesday morning, restaurant was partially full, and we were seated right away.  Our server was waiting on a large party, so our service was a bit slow.  The menu is huge, but we each opted for the 2 egg breakfast.  Our food arrived, and I was personally underwhelmed.  The portions are huge, but nothing really stood out for me.  I received 2 pieces of bacon, 2 eggs, potatoes and a huge biscuit.  I really wanted butter for my biscuit, while it was still sorta warm, but our server was attending to the large party and my breakfast grew cold and my coffee cup was empty, while waiting.  When we were finally able to flag her down, I did ask for fresh biscuit and an extra order of bacon, the 2 small pieces included, just didn't cut it.  My husband was undewhelmed as well.  Not sure that I would return.</td></tr><tr><td>zAvLCsGTlkbFZZGYjLUuEQ</td><td>-1</td><td>My first visit since the move to the corner of 9th & Superior.  I had visited the old location a few times in the past and never had a bad meal.   I visited here for lunch during the Holiday break, so there was a steady stream of customers, but not overly crowded.  I ordered the tabouli salad which was priced at $6.99, I had printed a coupon from the website which granted $1.00 off.  I ordered my salad, to go.  I arrived back at work with a decent portion (not sure it was worth the $6.99 menu price, but not a bad deal with $1.00 off.   The tabouli was definitely freshly made because the bulgur was still a bit hard, and the flavors hadn't quite meshed together yet.  Lots of tomatoes and too many onions for my taste.  Also tasted like bottled lemon juice had been used instead of fresh squeezed lemons. The salad was accompanied by large piece of pita that had been cut into 4 triangles.  All in all my salad was decent.  I will return, but will probably choose a different menu item.</td></tr><tr><td>DvR6Z5038DZc8_48HLQMEQ</td><td>-1</td><td>I was contacted by the manager shortly after my review.

I stopped here, after searching Yelp for Columbian food, while running errands of the West side of the city.  The restaurant is located in small strip of storefronts, if you blink, you'll miss it.  I entered, requested a menu, I was handed a menu that had absolutely seen better days.  There were no takeout menus, available.  I ordered the chicharrones, chicken and cheese pupusa and sweet plantains.  My order was \"to go\", not sure that I would eat on-site.  The wait began, along with at least 7 other customers.  I waited for approx 30 minutes.  My total was less than $8, and I must admit, the portions were very generous.  I get to my car and peek in the bag.  I have 3 styrofoam plates (not containers), wrapped in foil and 2 plastic sandwich bags with slaw (curtido) and tomato sauce.  I felt as though I was leaving a relatives house with dinner leftovers.  Anyway, I arrived home and the food was still warm, even though I live 25 minutes away.  The pupusa was tasty, and seasoned well.  I was kinda expecting fried pork belly, for the chicharrones, but instead received deep fried chunks of fried pork loin.  The pork was well seasoned, but a bit dry, stringy and hard to chew.  The plantains were just ok, not quite as ripe as they should have been, a little bit hard and not very sweet.  I will return, to try some of the other dishes, such as the tacos and quesadillas.</td></tr><tr><td>2q6uhmrpp717gSNFuCXGqw</td><td>-1</td><td>I'll definitely have to re-visit for dinner, based on Yelp reviews.  I had lunch there and definitely was not blown away.   I went on a recent Friday afternoon, not crowded, but not empty either.  I was seated right away.   There was a little bit of a wait before someone came by to take my order.   I ordered the lunch portion of Szechuan Shrimp, which came with Fried Rice and an egg roll.  While waiting for my order, I noticed that everyone around me, had pots of hot tea, I flagged down my waitress and asked for tea, she seemed a little bit bothered, but brought it shortly thereafter.   My order arrived, pretty large portion for lunch.  The fried rice, was just that, no veggies, just brown tinted rice.  The eggroll was just ok, nothing extraordinary and a little bit dry.  The eggroll was accompanied by some type of fruit sauce (pineapple maybe), that was also, just ok.   The entree, where do I start?   The Szechuan Shrimp was absolutely drenched in a huge amount of what looked (and tasted) like hoisin sauce with a few red pepper flakes for heat.   The selection of vegetables was just ok, kinda looked like a hodge podge of whatever was laying around in the kitchen.   I walked away from my lunch very disappointed.   There was a direct view of the area behind the register (also where the drink dispenser was located), I could see supplies, garbage etc.  Also there was a big pool of water in front of the register, as I was checking out.   Needless to say, I REALLY wanted to like this place but it really missed the mark for me.   I will give it a another try, in order to try some of the more authentic cuisine, such as the salt-baked selections.  Just not sure that I will return soon:-(</td></tr><tr><td>6DKi-23kmqN4-8X9ODFC7g</td><td>-1</td><td>I've been here many, many times for brunch, dinner and happy hour and I've never had a bad meal, but last night's meal was the BEST that I've ever had at Grovewood.  I started with the seasonal salad which consisted of torn butter lettuce topped with pepitas and tossed with a shallot viniagrette.  For my entree, I chose the fried chicken and OMG was it good!   The portion was huge, 4 pieces of chicken that had been marinated and deep-fried to crispy/crunchy/juicy perfection and then drizzled with a honey/chile glaze, which was equally tasty.  The chicken was accompanied by an order of braised collard greens which were seasoned perfectly and an ample portion of mac & cheese.  The entree also featured a HUGE cheddar scallion biscuit. The mac&cheese could have been served just a bit warmer and maybe a bit creamer, but it was still tasty.  Hubby ordered the Lake Erie perch dinner with fries and housemade slaw, which he enjoyed.  The only downside was that our server was a bit rough around the edges, but other than that we left Grovewood Tavern, very full and very happy!</td></tr><tr><td>ZwFMqeJOzZy-lYhcIvm5zA</td><td>-1</td><td>Line caught Tuna sandwich was not edible, I got take out and by the time I got back to the room I was too lazy to send it back.

The entrance was non-descript and would have been easily missed if we didn't know what to look for. We rang the bell and waited a few minutes before someone came to open the door. The atmosphere was on the casual side even though there were some who were dressed up. The cocktails were interesting and ranged in price from $12-$20. I chose Study Abroad which was on the sweeter side. I thought The Coldroom could have used an extra person on staff - the place was maybe 1/2 full but the two bartenders still seemed very busy. It took a while for someone to clear the glasses from our seats and no one came by to wipe down the table - same with getting our order taken.

It's a complete scam. I'm talking about the zombies ride. We had to wait 3 hours for 8 minutes experience. That'a shame. I only shot 4 times when I paid $5 for extra 100 rounds I didn't use at all. Do yourself a favor and run away from this place.</td></tr><tr><td>Famp3Fw7G7b68mU6e7drIw</td><td>-1</td><td>We came to this hotel mostly because of the pool reviews. The hotel itself is not that bad. The problem with the hotel is its clientele are right out of the hood. To say the least we did not feel safe. Horrible service out by the pool we actually had to even cancel an order it took so long. Our advice would be as to stay at one of the big hotels in Vegas and take a taxi to Fremont Street for fun. There is a lot more we can say negative about this hotel but I think you're getting the idea.</td></tr><tr><td>teUfOzUSGVappd-8bx99_g</td><td>-1</td><td>I've been hear three times. The first time was awesome, second time good, and third time terrible. The quality has really went down. My husband ordered a breakfast sausage sandwich. The sausage tasted like italian that you put on pizza. What the hell? Nasty! I had the waffle sandwich, very runny gravy. On top of that, we had to wait 30 minutes for our food, and we were only the second table there. Had a cronut to go, hard as a rock. Couldn't even nuke it to bring it back to life. Needless to say, If I wanna spend $30 for 2 people for breakfast, it won't be there where I had to throw half the food away. Beware, don't waste your money on lackluster food. I definitely know I will never return!</td></tr><tr><td>0zmV5NFUzxdUwoJI-SEPSw</td><td>-1</td><td>My husband and I dine here on a regular basis. The food is good, however, the service is hit and miss. After tonight, i will not return. Twice in 6 months we've had crappy service. We waited 25 minutes in the lounge to put in our food order. Bartenders too busy at the bar to acknowledge us. We had the hostess sit us somewhere else, she was nice and apologized. No response from a manager or the server. I feel like they could care less about the customers. Too many places in Vegas to go to and get much better service.</td></tr><tr><td>4kfhNY8TJCtT-lus8BBLRw</td><td>-1</td><td>Being a San Francisco native I fell in love with this place for many reasons!  First, the owner is from SF...super nice guy who takes the time to get to know you.  You feel like a \"regular\" right off the bat!  Second, the ambiance is fresh, trendy, and very clean.  Third, the food is AMAZING!  You can't go wrong with anything you order!  \n\nThis is one restaurant that each time we go we try different things and we are never disappointed.  Two of my favorites are the Grilled Halibut and Panang Curry.  The Spring Rolls are a perfect, light start to the meal.  The flavors are aromatic, fresh, and perfectly cooked.  \n\nI've notice some other reviews mention the portion sizes.  I agree, their apps and entrees are on the \"smaller\" side but this is comparable to some restaurants who serve you way too much food.  I truly feel they serve healthy portion sizes.  We've never walked away hungry (and my husband could be a champion eater!!)  I guess the only caveat is we never have a to-go box of the delicious food to take home ; )\n\nAlso, if you like wine the owner has other bottles that aren't on his list and he prices them well...just need to ask!\n\nLatitude Eight is a gem in Downtown Chandler!!</td></tr><tr><td>tbs_OYGIBaxEHJPGyzVITw</td><td>-1</td><td>Ok, I love Imperial Palace. 50 bucks a night for a place right on the strip and 5 dollar craps?? YEEEEEWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!! Yes, the hotel needs a lot of upkeep, but it's not anywhere near horrible, and it's such a good deal for people like me who cannot afford 100 dollar buy ins at a nice hotel. They also have celebrity impersonator dealers and entertainment while you gamble. \n\nCheap gambling, no bed bugs, and decent rooms. :)</td></tr><tr><td>xA0wQS2QbLqN1E82NauNsw</td><td>-1</td><td>I had a blast when I came to Fremont Street with my bf's parents. We were looking for something a bit different to do in Vegas and came here to check it out.  Fremont Street is supposed to be the Old Vegas, but strangely it feels too bright to be real, and too new to be old. This is something you'll have to see for yourself. The strip in comparison feels much richer in history and style. \n\nWith that said, this place is a gambling paradise. 3 dollar craps table buy ins and slot machines that never stop chiming. Cocktail waitresses with hair styled big enough to house at least 10 small sparrows in it, while being older than the Hoover Dam. \n\nI don't know if I would stay on Fremont Street if I was coming here with a big group of friends. It's off the strip, the crowd is much older, and it doesn't have the excitement and wonder of the strip. However, I would stay here during the summer for a tame couples trip, probably at the Golden Nugget to enjoy their gazillion gallon shark tank water slide with cheap neighborhood gambling. \n\nYou can also experience a 20 dollar zip line over the entire street. Save your monies, put your stunna shades on, and head to Fremont and get lucky in the casinos here. It's worth it for the gambling alone.</td></tr><tr><td>_UdLs0EBLZMWkBOvQobZYg</td><td>-1</td><td>Shady bouncers and gross ghetto crowd. Should rename the place chewbacca water hole.

It's well worth the wait but if you are in a hurry then you may want to go elsewhere - but you will be missing out on some really good food</td></tr><tr><td>SPx4jXXAO6zH9E_2k3SqiA</td><td>-1</td><td>Our initial impression of Pierre was very positive.Â  I really liked the photos on his website, so I set up a phone interview with him.Â  He impressed us with his wedding timeline knowledge, and really made us feel at ease with the planning work we had ahead of us.Â  We hired him, and had follow up phone calls that helped us get our timeline nailed down.Â  It seemed like we hired a real pro...\n\nIt all started to go downhill after we agreed to pay in full several months before the wedding.Â  After that, getting ahold of him became much more difficult.Â  We tried calling him to discuss specifics, but it took him around a week to get back to us.Â  Annoying, but it was wedding season, so I can excuse some delays in getting back to clients.\n\nHowever, the days leading up to the wedding is where his unresponsiveness starting becoming completely unacceptable. We called all of our vendors to confirm they were booked for our wedding, which they all confirmed immediately... except Pierre.Â  We sent multiple emails (3 and 2 days before the wedding), all without a response.Â  Finally, the day before the wedding, we tried calling him multiple times and he wasn't picking up his phone!Â At this point we are kind of freaking out thinking he wasn't going to make our wedding and we would have to find another photographer.Â  He finally got ahold of us less than 12 hours before the wedding and said that he thought he emailed us but the email was still in his outbox and never sent.Â  Excuse #1...\n\nThe wedding day went very smoothly.Â  Pierre and his assistant arrived on time and directed us through our pre-ceremony and post-cermony photo shoots that required a lot of coordination.Â  He was there for the first half of the reception and when he left he informed us that our photos would be ready in around 4 weeks.  That was better than we expected, so we ended the wedding very happy with Pierre, despite his unresponsiveness in the days leading up to the wedding.\n\nThis is the point in the review where Pierre's behavior becomes completely unacceptable.Â  We went on our honeymoon a few weeks after our wedding, so we were fully expecting to see our edited pictures from Pierre by the time we got back home.Â  It is 6 weeks out from our wedding at this point, and we were surprised that nothing was in our inbox.Â  We wait 2 more weeks, and try to email him to see if he has a status update for us.Â  Crickets.Â  We email him again, and still no response.Â  We try calling him and left him a few voicemail messages.Â  Finally, a few weeks after we started contacting him, he got back to us.Â  He said that one of their editing computers crashed, and that he lost edits for our wedding and a bunch of others (have you ever heard of backups?).Â  Excuse #2...\n\nAt this point we are pretty upset that he was so delayed, but we understand that \"shit happens\" and we would have to wait a bit longer than expected.Â  He said that he would get back to us in a week with a status update, and of course, a week later, we don't hear back from him.Â  We send him an email asking for an update... nothing... again.Â  We send more emails... nothing.Â  We call and leave voice mail messages asking for updates... nothing.Â  At this point, my wife is getting very upset (understandably), but I'm trying my hardest not to get too upset in my voicemail messages because this guy still needs to edit our photos and I want him to do a good job!\n\nWe are now 12 weeks out from our wedding and we haven't heard from our photographer in weeks despite us trying everything to get ahold of him.Â  We don't know what to think at this point: Did he lose all of our photos and not just the edited ones and is ignoring us?Â  Is he not responding to us because something happened to him?Â  We are dumfounded and don't know what to do.Â  I'm leaving voicemail messages threatening legal action and I'm stalking him on social media to try to find a way to contact him.\n\nFINALLY, I find a way to get ahold of the assistant photographer that worked our wedding on Facebook, and she explains to me that Pierre has been busy the last couple of weeks with family issues.Â  Excuse #3.Â  Dealing with family issues DOES NOT mean you can't respond to a client for a month.Â  Someone should be monitoring your email or responding to voicemail messages if you can't.Â  There is no excuse that makes this type of unresponsiveness acceptable.Â  Anyway, the assistant photographer said that they were almost done with the photos, and would get them to us in a few days.Â  I was extremely skeptical at this point, but lo-and-behold, a few days later we had our pictures!\n\nSo, 15 weeks out from our wedding and more stress and frustration than you can imagine, we have our wedding photos.Â  They are very good, but nothing quite as artistic as you see on his website. Overall, I would not recommend anyone use Pierre's Portrait Art for their wedding, unless they're OK with someone never returning your phone calls.</td></tr><tr><td>J_Shv_o0T7brddloTo04pw</td><td>-1</td><td>Die hard Chicagoan here....so my expectations are somewhat \"elevated\" when it comes to food from my beloved hometown. Like Nicole said, is it the best Chicago dog I've ever had? Not even close. Is it the best Chicago dog in Charlotte? I say YES. They've got the traditional ingredients down pat, the Vienna beef sausage (yes, that's what a \"hot dog\" is.....an encased meat sausage), the neon green relish, the steamed poppy seed bun (which is the quintessential defining part of a Chicago dog), sport peppers, tomato, a pickle and MUSTARD (Chicago dogs NEVER, repeat, NEVER EVER use Ketchup!). \n\nSo I got a Chicago Dog and a special called the Fire Dog today which was a spicy Polish sausage with grilled onions, brown mustard and I opted for the sauerkraut. It was a good dog, with all the flavors expected. Fries are usually good here, but my criticism is that they lack some seasonings.....hell use Lawry's Seasoned Salt or something and fry them a tad longer to get more of a crisp on them. They're not bad but certainly CAN be better!\n\nBeing a lover of Portillos, Mr. Beef and Al's in Chicago, Matt's version of Chicago Beef is just meh.....sausage isn't bad but their beef just isn't flavorful enough for my tastes. I mean it's not bad, just not up to my expectation from what I remember from back home. OK now I'm being picky and critical.....me bad. \n\nFor first time visitors, just know that the portions are NOT very big (at least for the dogs). Recommend getting a combo with 2 Chicago Dogs or a combo Beef/Sausage. Even the females in my group complained that one dog wasn't quite enough. Jumbo dog is also an option. They should offer a TWO DOG JUMBO combo for us bigger eaters.\n\nSo overall I love Matt's as it does provide me with a LITTLE taste of home. I can only hope that SOMEONE opens up a REAL CHICAGO PIZZA place here in Charlotte....while I love thin pizza, there IS MUCH BETTER out there so please someone, open a Giordano's here! PLEASE! :-)</td></tr><tr><td>HXqKNiwcBrfDvAb6r6uN-A</td><td>-1</td><td>Bought same Living Social voucher as others and had to schedule out 2 1/2 months, never got to speak to a real person and when I went to send confirmation e-mail on day of service, e-mail bounced, website no longer in existence, and phone no longer in service.

It's HUGE with tons of fun for all ages including toddlers. It's usually about 85 degrees inside so it feels like you're at the beach . There's a wave pool, water slides, and much more. There's a Bowling alley, arcade room with games for adults & kids and they also have a few places to eat & drink in/outside the water park & lobby. HOWEVER...the rooms are HORRIBLE. Unfortunately you have to be a guest at the lodge to utilize the waterpark. Upon arrival we were given wrist bands to access the waterpark & told we would receive a text when our room was ready. That text came about 90 mins later. Once inside the room, i was in compete shock! It was not clean or well kept. The tub was dirty & so were the floors. One big useless room with old wood fixtures & lamp shades. The sofa bed was the worst I've ever seen. The queen bed wasn't fully made & there was hair in the sheets...ewwww!!! I was literally scared to sleep. There is a jet tub in the whirl pool suite but as you can imagine...it was a fail as well. Only jets worked..sad shame! There's a small fridge, small microwave & a 32\" Philips TV. A bunch of bull for $500/night. I'm so disappointed, I'll NEVER visit this place again. The only highlight of the day was the mall...Concord Mills! It's right up the street along with other shopping centers & restaurants. I went out for some retail therapy to get my mind off this catastrophe. Did I mention this lodge is right off the interstate which allows me to hop right on & escape the horror of the Great Wolf!

I was with my eight year old little sister, I feel like individuals with such attitude should not be working in an environment where children come to play arcade games. \n\nI decided to talk to a Manager, because I was still stunned by this Jacob individual and the manager said he understood and would have a talk with him.

Kids over 10 should steer clear -- unless they want to revert to their childhood and have a rip roaring time.  Also, every room is supervised by a kindly docent, who make sure everyone is safe and having fun.  They take time to show the little ones how everything works.

My bread plate and water glass was never empty.  No request was too small and the attention to detail, was superb!  My friend and I dined here on a busy Friday night, making a reservation thru Open Table.  As other reviewers have stated, the prices are not cheap, but I also firmly believe that you get what you pay for.  The wine, by the glass, was way over-priced in my opinion, but the food was fairly priced based on the quality.  I ordered the potato encrusted Grouper with haricot verts in a beurre blanc sauce.  There were a few bones in the Grouper, but nothing major.  The portion was ample, and the sauce was devine.  My friend ordered the salmon and was equally pleased.  We both opted for the beignets for dessert, which were just ok, probably would try one of the souffles or bread pudding on a future visit.  All in all, I would return!</td></tr><tr><td>GDyWFmUZtURpmW_tgx2-MQ</td><td>-1</td><td>Wow, can't believe for as long as I've worked downtown, I've never visited Zen Cuisine!   I visited today for the first time and I will absolutely return.  I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken, which was cooked to order, with nice crunchy bean sprouts, and other veggies with white rice.  The portion was very generous, and tasty, especially for $4.59!   I learned while waiting for my order that they also offer brown rice and wheat udon noodles, I'll remember that next time.  The gentleman taking orders was SUPER nice.  I'll be back!!</td></tr><tr><td>1v7EqEbyzriL-bmm1IRyXA</td><td>-1</td><td>First time here, went with co-workers.   I never knew that this place existed.  It's tucked nicely away in a large office building.  The place was pretty crowded for lunch on a Monday.   Serves diner type food.  I opted for the grilled chicken wrap with fries for $6.25.  The sandwich was served fresh and warm with shredded cheese, lettuce tomato and ranch dressing with a side of crinkle cut fries.    I would definitely return, the food, price and value can't be beat.</td></tr><tr><td>T9Vr_ezAZusxeQ4mqeaQUA</td><td>-1</td><td>I was in the area craving Asian noodles/rice.  I was going to try Thai Orchid in Mentor, but they were closed for the weekend, due to a family reunion.  I order pizza from Jet's, which is next door to the Panda Chinese restaurant, all the time, but had never tried this restaurant before.  I stopped in on a Sunday, and was a little bit hesitant, because the restaurant was relatively empty.  I'm not a big fan of buffet style restaurants, but was hungry and tired.  I was pleasantly surprised that the food looked fresh, and wasn't dried out from sitting out too long (except for the sushi and cheesecake, neither was chilled properly.....I'll pass!).   I had a number of routine Asian buffet dishes that all in all were pretty decent.   There was plenty of fresh fruit for dessert.  As I mentioned, this was just ok, I'll probably visit again at some point.</td></tr><tr><td>VWMjSeiYGkhp5pPp26IbzA</td><td>-1</td><td>Wow, what a difference a few weeks and a second visit makes.  I eagerly anticipated returning to Six Penn after the first 5 star visit while traveling to Pittsburgh on business.   This visit was less than stellar.   The menu had changed which is understandable, although I was looking forward to ordering the brussel sprouts that I had during the previous visit, but I guess those were a part of the winter menu as was the deconstructed wedge salad.   There was not much that interested me on the \"Spring\" menu so I proceeded to order a la carte.   I ordered the flash fried calamari and rock shrimp, side of parmesan rosemary fries and a side of french green beans.   The calamari and rock shrimp were not very crispy, kinda greasy and had no flavor.  There was lots of calamari and very few shrimp.   The fries were just luke warm with very little parmesan cheese and no rosemary flavoring.  The french green beans were a complete \"miss' for me.  Steamed whole green bean, dressed in an herb vinagrette with grape halves and whole toasted hazelnuts.   The vinagrette had very little flavor and the grapes and hazelnuts just didn't belong.  I left very disappointed, especially compared to my first visit.</td></tr><tr><td>p76KZbO-HsagF8eVkhNBQQ</td><td>-1</td><td>I had not been to Hard Rock in a couple of years.  I can say that the menu has expanded and much more creative than the last time that I was there.  I had lunch there on a Friday afternoon.   The restaurant was fairly full.  The music was pretty loud which is ok since it is Hard Rock.  I ordered the Haystack Chicken salad which was pretty good.   The saladl combines fresh mixed greens, carrots, corn, pico de gallo, shredded cheese and grilled chicken breast (fried chicken tenders are also available. The salad came with with ranch dressing and topped with spiced pecans and tortilla straws.   The salad was huge, the ingredients were fresh.   The ranch dressing was pretty bland and watery, but really didn't matter because the salad was very flavorable, on it's own.   Our server was very attentive, consistently filling our glasses, brought extra napkins etc.   The only downside was that the restaurant was collecting for some type of fundraiser, so on top of the loud music, one of the employees kept making annoucements requesting donations.   Other than that, all was pretty ok.   I would return to try other menu offerings.</td></tr><tr><td>VeIJuhj3tJmuThGWlmysqw</td><td>-1</td><td>Yard House is a beer lover's dream.

Our usual joint was booked and we thought we would try something new.  From the outside, David's Hamburgers looked like a good place to try.  Stepping inside, was quite different, but not in a bad way.  They feature an authentic Yodeler from Branson, MO, and have her posters everywhere, along with a 50's style theme.  It works for what it is, a hamburger joint, right?\nOur problems started from the moment we walked in the door. The restaurant had one other patron, sitting at the counter, and there were 7 of us, four adults and three kids. My mom, daughter and I arrived first, ordered our coffee and OJ and waited for the others.  They strolled in about 10 minutes later.  We didn't see a server for at least 20 minutes.  At this point, there are more guests walking through the door, looking to fill their hungry bellies.  Our server finally notices we have added to our group and we give her our entire order, as we didn't know when she might come back.  I could see she did not have a lot of help, so I gave her a break, understanding her being flustered.  We found entertainment with the Yodeler, and the kids weren't losing it...yet.\nAn hour and fifteen minutes after we showed up, the food arrived in two orders, 10 minutes apart. It was cold and not very good.  My pancakes had turned rubbery and the sausage was overcooked to almost burnt, but my eggs were undercooked.  It was the same around the table.  Complaining, once I grabbed a manager, did no good.  He took my mom's plate of biscuits and  gravy back and microwaved it, as if it was normal. He never offered to take the food I clearly couldn't eat off of my bill. If this is the type of service they are offering, I'm not buying...ever again.\nI was surprised to see such disregard for customer service and in Old Town Scottsdale?</td></tr><tr><td>Epm3qXH-S_01CSmLn1EFRg</td><td>-1</td><td>Hoooooorrdrrrrrriiiiiiiiibbbbbbbbblllllllleeeeeeee!!!!!!

Would have been 3.5 stars for the food initially, but the environment and lack of plating knocks down a star. We got an appetizer trio with the guacamole, nacho cheese (spicy), and a salsa, served with a basket of chips. Then we also ordered shrimp and chicken fajitas, and the chipotle honey wings (cheaper during happy hour). The food was decent initially, but we realized how they put absolutely no effort into plating after i took pictures with flash of our food. It's way too dark to see your food clearly when you eat it. We actually struggled to read our menus by candlelight. The guac wasn't as fresh as it is at chipotle. It turned out to be on the brown side (see pictures). The chips didn't taste housemade. Hubby and I really enjoyed the flavor of the chipotle honey sauce on the wings. The fajita was brought out on a sizzling pan with extra toppings and the tortilla separately. However, we didn't like how the back of our booth was the same surface as a bar area. We had this weird fear that the guy with drinks behind us might accidentally drop his drink or food on us. Also, the volume of the music being played kept getting cranked up louder and louder, so we had to yell to hear each other. The tables are a bit too close for comfort. And to top it off, I never got a single water refill. Overall, it's a very crowded, dark, and loud place. And when you ask for containers for leftovers... Somehow the math works out where 3 containers need 2 lids. I think we 'll stick with chipotle next time. It seems absurd that some families would bring their babies and kids here. It's not really a family friendly place, more like a bar that serves food. The bar area was definitely packed by the time hubby and I finished our dinner and were ready to leave. We didn't try any of the drinks... So can't say anything about that...</td></tr><tr><td>rbFOuxaIPLP31MbaGrOSYQ</td><td>-1</td><td>Scariest/shadiest grocery store experience in my life.

Also this is the only Giant Eagle tht gives you a really hard time if you ever forget your advantage card and give your phone no instead (it works at the other ones just fine). Then we leave by waiting for a really dazed/swaying woman to finish wandering around back and forth in front of us, and pass by a drive-by fat cash exchange (drugs?) on our way out of the parking lot. We are definitely scared to return, and will never need grapes (or any other groceries) so desperately again.</td></tr><tr><td>GqyMjjN6nCqhk6B7wo3Dmg</td><td>-1</td><td>This is an exceptionally terrible location for Freshii. First, the staff seem miserable and don't even try to fake enjoying their work, which makes it very unpleasant for patrons. Poor customer service is always a turn-off.\n\nSecond, they had an item on their menu that they no longer made in store, which is deceptive and misleading. At the counter, the staff member's response to my question about the missing and non-existing item was utterly unsatisfactory too, which compounded the situation.\n\nFinally, this Freshii doesn't allow you to make custom bowls, which is probably the best reason to even consider visiting Freshii, overpriced as it is. They should simply take down the sign, close up shop, and cut their losses... this place damages the brand and gives Freshii a bad name.</td></tr><tr><td>dvbVxeoKpDUVQfrV9fu1Kw</td><td>-1</td><td>I have been to this location before and they have had good service. But tonight I when I went it was different I know that it was 30 min before closing but that should not make a difference. But what bugs me the most is that I paid $36! For my dinner with a buy one get one free. I ordered the tacos and got each one different and they charged me for three different plates! I asked the employee before I ordered if it was ok to do that and if there would be an extra cost and they said nothing which is shady! I paid the money without being rude. \nBut will never comeback to this location and I will tell all my friends and family to stay away from this location. Pulling one over on someone for extra side charges is distasteful and bad customer service. \nI hope the manager sees this because this was unacceptable!</td></tr><tr><td>tmhyq2oFW67i4XOo40yFYA</td><td>-1</td><td>Thursday Night Buffet on 6/14/2018 was disgusting!

Everything from the breads placed on our table to the Cesar salad, to the french fries, to the smoked prawn cakes, everything was beyond good.

If you are going to serve \"Southern Soul Food\" then take it from a southerner from GA, you do not serve dried out, precooked fried chicken. Fried chicken should be cooked to order in a restaurant like this.  Waffles were soggy as though they were precooked as well. While the chicken had a good flavor, white meat was extremely dry and skin wasn't crispy though very dark brown.  Dark meat was more moist but also over cooked on the outside.  Service was average for a restaurant of this style.

I ordered a kids cheeseburger(ketchup only) happy meal and some other items. My mistake for not checking the bag and box for the correct item.  \nWe get home start handed out food and my son opens his Happy Meal and there is no cheeseburger, all other things are in the box. So I proceed to call the store and ask for a manager. She tells me that she is sorry that the cheeseburger didn't get into the box(mean while I have a 3 year old in tears.) She said it was sitting still in the window as no on realized it didn't get into the box. She gave me two options: 1. Come back and get the food. 2. She could refund the money if she had my physical card in her hand. Neither of which worked because it was out of my way. She said she would put it on the books that I wanted a refund and when I got a chance to come back to the store, speak to a manager in duty and they would help me out. \nToday I was in that area and I decided to stop. Asked to speak to the manager, took several minutes for some one to find her. Her name was Rosaria, I told her my dilemma and what was said on 6-11-15. She proceeded to tell me that the only way I was able to get my money back was if I returned the food to them, she could give me another happy meal if I liked. I declined as it was after lunch and my son didn't want one anymore. So I asked her to check the office and see what the other manager wrote. She said there is no way I can refund the money without food being returned. \nSo I turned around and told my son lets go. He's in tears again because the lady was mean and we left. \nI will NEVER return to that specific McDonald's.  That may have been the breaking point for all McDonald's.</td></tr><tr><td>b-JHSBlsmmZyMof--h86lA</td><td>-1</td><td>I had heard of this place, but had never stopped.

He also discredits the groupon, so he had negative attitude towards the service period. I paid an additional $55 for some chemical service as well.

We have since gotten a documented letter from our home inspector that states the exact testing that he completes on every home HVAC unit, including taking temperature readings at every vent in the home.  He Stated that our HVAC unit was fully functioning upon inspection.  \n\nWe also had an Investigation completed by the Registrar of Contractors on the contractor that OneGuard used to initially repair our A/C unit in April 2016. This was found to be when OneGuard instructed their contractor to wire the system directly so only the A/C works as a \"dirt cheap\" way to repair the A/C but completely compromise the heating unit.  The ROC found that the contractor is guilty of doing this in fact.  The Contractor stated that OneGuard instructed their technician to complete the repair this way. OneGuard then used their fraudulent repair work as an excuse to make our heat repair claim denial, stating that our heating unit was not working prior to our move in and we didn't have it properly inspected.  This evidence clearly shows the FRAUD that OneGuard committed. They FRAUDULENTLY repaired our HVAC Unit by compromising the heat system and then FRAUDULENTLY made claims that our heating system was missing parts and wasn't functional prior to our home inspection. We are now updating the Attorney General and Dept. of Insurance complaints against OneGuard, with the new evidence we have against them. We will also be pursuing arbitration with OneGuard Home Warranty.

Clean and cute environment. \n\nI would come by again if I had to grab something quick. \n\nVisited: Not sure of exact date, but once late 2017 and sometime in January 2018.</td></tr><tr><td>aMpYlkzNmIo8h54-PJVDIg</td><td>-1</td><td>Drinks were by far worst drinks of any bar we went to, very watered down.

If you're on vacation in Vegas, you'll probably want something nicer unless you're a grumpy old person who doesn't care about shitty coffee, kinda dirty rooms, and hallways that still have last night's drunken puke/Pine Sol smell floating about them. Of course, this is Vegas.\n\nHowever, the front desk people are friendly enough, and the place is cheap. They also have passable Wi-fi... And what's more.... It's a very short walk to the Las Vegas Convention Center, WHICH MEANS:\n\nIf you're in Vegas to WORK, that is to say you're a journalist or an exhibitor attending CES or one of the other trade shows at the LVCC, this place is the best kept secret. Why pay three times the price if you're just using the room to crash out and type on your laptop? \n\nSo, if you're bringing your significant other, avoid this place. It's not sexy to hear a drunk old guy banging a ratty hooker in the next room. If, on the other hand, you want to avoid the overpriced hullabaloo and get some work done, I actually recommend this place.\n\nOn a side note, the staff informed me that they've really worked hard to beef up their internet. 15 new access points and a new router from their ISP with upgraded service. They also trained every employee about customer expectations for internet access and how to reset APs. Not bad. I just did a speedtest too:\n\nhttp://www.speedtest.net/result/1694946204.png</td></tr><tr><td>LMNfIfOcv4Gl92agOqF5mg</td><td>-1</td><td>The worst Denny's I've ever been to. I don't even know where to start, because most of my experience was unbelievable.\n\nI'll start with the 15 minute wait to get seated while astonishingly bored and uncaring employees strolled back and forth. Once in a while someone would look disinterestedly at us and hold a finger up, ostensibly to say \"one more minute\", even as the bulk of the restaurant was relatively empty.\n\nThen there is, of course, the clientele. I mean, it's the north end of the strip, so yeah... There are families with 17 kids and awkward old men with hookers. That's fine, it's Vegas, but when you're agitated as it is, this kind of stuff doesn't help.\n\nOh, the service. We had Mr. \"I seriously don't give a shit that you're here. What do you want to eat?\" as our waiter.\n\nAfter ordering, I got up to go into the bathroom. THE BATHROOM WAS COVERED IN BLOOD.\n\nI can't make this up, Yelp friends. The bathroom looked like a murder scene. There was blood sprayed all over the floor, the mirror, the sinks, the counter, and the paper towel dispenser. Fresh blood. After that, it may as well have been my appetite that got butchered in there.\n\nI told the staff about the blood and the manager at least looked concerned, in the \"oh my, what else do I have to deal with tonight\" sense. They scurried off to figure out what happened. \n\nI got my food, and it was served on a dirty plate. The final straw. This place is a fucking shithole. Go to the other Denny's, go to Walgreen's next door and buy Doritos for dinner, or even better, go to The Peppermill that's a hundred feet away, it's way, WAY better for the same price.</td></tr><tr><td>jGml2YmJ2JUBzLJFur_hcw</td><td>-1</td><td>The best haircut I've ever had!

Same man as above was reprimanding kitchen staff loud enough it could be heard by those close enough to the kitchen. The staff that delivers food were pleasant when bringing food.

There are a few notable things I would like to mention:\n\n1) The atomic burger is an above average burger made with creekstone beef; however at $10.75 without any fries or sides included is way way way overpriced given the small portion size. \n\n2) They fry everything in lard. This is actually a huge deal in that literally nearly everything contains pork which excludes many potential diners with dietary restriction (ie religious). Additionally this makes the food (unnecessarily) significantly heavier and unhealthier without adding much quality. \n\n3) They do have one fryer that contains vegetable oil however they will only fry French fries and gluten-free menu items in this as to maintain gluten-free options. However this means you cannot get onion rings, onion strings, chicken sandwich, etc without it being deep fried in lard. \n\nVery dissatisfied. Will not return again. In comparison to a Red Robin burger, this burger is inferior in taste and portion size. Additionally, it is more expensive than RR, does not come fries, and the menu is very restricted if you don't want your food fried in lard.</td></tr><tr><td>oqLYrFXD7m66GnsbsbtdvA</td><td>-1</td><td>The worst steak I've ever eaten in my life.

Than when we got our order we were surprised by the bill. We still left a 20% tip because we wanted it to be clear that we really were just unhappy with the service and lack of apology or even care when our bill was double what we thought and that it wasn't about us trying to save money.

The Wynn is the nicest hotel in Las Vegas and this was the most expensive buffet I had ever purchased. I LOVE seafood including snow crab legs and cocktail shrimp. I sampled a variety of food on the buffet and was most excited about the shrimp and crab legs. BUT when I found them (they are at the very end of the buffet) the cocktail shrimp were room temperature, almost warm, (ewwww) and the snow crab legs were split in half and almost dried out. That alone almost ruined my buffet experience and was the sole reason I went. The only thing that saved my experience was the dessert bar with miniature gourmet desserts. I will NOT be back unless I get comped buffet vouchers in the future. My service was terrible also, no one would come wait on me and take my drink order so I had to get the hostess to go get my drinks. When I wanted a refill I had to track down the hostess again; because again, no one would wait on me. That's unacceptable service for the Wynn.</td></tr><tr><td>sEfqVI-SJ0bj7MySe2oWZA</td><td>-1</td><td>I don't really know what to say about this place. I've stayed here 3 or 4 times. Including booking the $1,500 Real World Suite.\n\nThe music is very loud but I can sleep through that. \n\nThe other guests is another thing entirely. I just moved back to Vegas and haven't gotten possession of my apartment yet which is why I booked a stay here. I'm allowed to have my small senior dog and I *use to* feel safe here, thinking that because it's gated and they are suppose to have security 24/7. I am working long hours, 12-14 hours a day at another hotel in town so I need my sleep. \n\nLast night my next door neighbors decided to beat each other up all night. There aren't phones in the rooms so I have to google the Oasis at Gold Spike phone number on my personal phone just to call the front desk. The front desk said they were sending security to deal with the domestic dispute and they never sent anyone. We are talking it's 4 or 5 in the morning at this point. My neighbors stayed up fighting until 7am. I finally fell asleep and was woken up by housekeeping knocking on my door at 10am. Checkout isn't until 11am. I go ahead and book another night stay on my phone because I desperately need the sleep before work. After I book I try calling the front desk, no answer. I fall back asleep and get woken up by housekeeping again and then a security guard saying I'm being kicked out because I didn't pay. I showed the confirmation on my phone and he said he didn't care and I had to go downstairs to talk to the front desk. Then the security guard and the maid start making fun of me because they think this is all funny. \n\nI get dressed, and while I'm walking downstairs I check my bank account and the money for the new stay has already been taken out. \n\nThe front desk person says they don't have my stay in the computer and treated me like a liar when I told her about the domestic dispute next door last night, saying she didn't have anything written down and when security is called they write everything down. The front desk lady calls security again just now and he says he doesn't know anything about the domestic dispute last night. At this point I'm pissed off, I haven't slept at all, I've been called a liar and no one apologized at all for the shitty treatment I've gotten at this hotel. All of this is incredibly unprofessional. \n\nHouse keeping also does a crap job cleaning because when I got in my room things were broken off the wall, and the floor hasn't been cleaned at all. There was pubic hair on the bathroom floor (that's not mine) when I checked in and so I went back and asked the front desk to please have my room cleaned again, which they said they would but they didn't clean again. I have been walking around barefoot inside my room and my feet are black and the pubic hair was still there so I had to clean it up myself. The rooms desperately need a deep cleaning because when I move the furniture to plug in my phone and accessories, there's trash and bottle caps behind it. There was also a lot ketchup on my lamp shade that has been there awhile and is not mine. \n\nLook, I get it, this is the 'real world party hotel', but you can still CLEAN the rooms, have security that actually does their job for something as serious as a domestic dispute fist fight, and have your employees not treat paying customers like shit.</td></tr><tr><td>QxgllXFu_xwuL-ZncCmUsg</td><td>-1</td><td>McMath Realty charged me $1,200 (rent amount) after I had informed them I would be moving out of the home. My lease was over for two months and I had been paying month to month. Their justification for the $1,200 charge was that I had not turned in the keys to their main office which I had through their after hours drop box. They kept my $500 deposit and sent a total of $2,600 in charges to NCC business services for them to collect. NCC tacked on an additional $1,200 in their own charges for handling the case. McMath had left me in a home without a working A/C unit for days at a time & also never fixed a leaking skylight that I have multiple email requests to have fixed as every time it rained the living room would flood. After their \"WONDERFUL\" tenant treatment $3,100 in charges and $1,200 in collection charges I'm not left with a $3,800 collection charge on my credit which is prohibiting me from changing my financial situation for the better. As a home owner I would never want a company like McMath to manage my property as they don't respect your home or your tenants. As a tenant I would rather sleep on the streets than work with a company that has no respect for the tax paying citizens they scam daily.

Sorry for the pun, but it was worth the gamble.\n\nWhile waiting in line for seating, I changed my mood and looked forward to the meal, wanting to order my favorite CPK meal, Chicken Milanese. Sadly, when I finally got a chance to open my menu, there was no Chicken Milanese listed! The California Pizza Kitchen website lists the dish as one of its specialties, so this came as a surprise.\n\nI went for my second favorite option (again, not pizza), the Original BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad, dressing on the side. I split it with my neighbor, who ordered the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza. The pizza was fine but the chicken in the salad, moist as it was, lacked enough BBQ sauce and thus zing that usually accompanies the crisp, fresh combination of ingredients in this salad. \n\nMy table asked for the sourdough bread to eat while waiting for the food. We got a pathetic hole/airy looking loaf along with some cold butter. We ate it and asked for more - no carb concern here, especially on vacay - and the second serving was better. \n\nThe wait staff took care of our requests with smiles and also refilled our waters and drinks regularly. Nonetheless, the food failed to match up to the standards that other CPK's have accustomed me to. My group, including first timers, enjoyed the experience overall, so I think they will be pleasantly surprised by the California Pizza Kitchen experience at home.</td></tr><tr><td>yccI5h9xR7NN7cnGtuH1Lg</td><td>-1</td><td>I don't give a lot of two star reviews, and I find rant reviews frustrating. For that reason, I'll try to give my thought out reason for the two star review. In short, it was for the experience. The food was actually pretty good. I'm from the Chicago area, and I think this place does a comparable job with Chicago style deep dish pizza, a few hours south of the real deal. \n\nSo the story is, I was coming here with 16 people. If you were going with fewer, I think you'd be fine. I think. \n\nWe called ahead. We were told we couldn't make a reservation unless we put in an order on the phone. We didn't do that, and when we got there the back dining room (not the front area because of a basketball game) was empty. The basketball game could be why the place was out of sorts with their service. Anyway, the staff at the front seemed to be aware of our phone call and, though seemingly difficult, they were able to put together some tables for us. The waiter was nice enough and took our drink orders and understood when we explained how many of us would be on separate checks (needing to get reimbursements) at the end of the meal.\n\nSince some people ordered the deep dish pizza that knowingly takes a long time to cook, we got cheesy garlic bread at my table to share, and it was so good. A pair in our group also ordered some and never got it. When they asked and the waiter said he would put it in, we were already nearly done with ours and pizza was coming shortly. They canceled that. For the entree, I got the lasagna because it was the Thursday special. It was a very generous portion that came with bread and salad. Though a good deal, the lasagna flavor wasn't anything to write home about, in fact, a bit too salty in my mind. The ricotta inside had nice herbs. Now, the pizza, is another story. I'll share a picture I took of the everything but the kitchen sink pizza a friend got. I was impressed. The issue was the timing. The four of us eating on my end of the table were nearly done before some in the middle and on the other end got their food.\n\nI know we were a large group, but the timing was very off. Several groups (a couple and a group of 3, I think) came in, ate, and left in the time we waited for our food. The waiter and kitchen seemed to need extra help. Another group of people we knew came in about a half hour after us and were told the place was out of deep dish. They only had one more lasagna. With 16 people, we cleared the Papa Del's kitchen. If you're going to try your luck with Papa Del's, I say get it for take out or go with a smaller group.</td></tr><tr><td>ERJXlQrkfUiyVNVEuzB_zA</td><td>-1</td><td>Food good, decent customer service, wait was terrible.\nThey have a ton of kids behind the counter working and a very mild dine-in crowd.

Until the first night. \n\n1) The shower was clogged so it fills up half way by the end of the shower. \n2) Ants EVERYWHERE. Not the nice little ones that just tickle you, but big mean ants that bite the second they get on you. \n3) Something kept biting me everytime I slept. Not ants, but something else. The saying \"don't let the bed bugs bite\" has a whole new meaning to me now. \n4) Front desk staff is incompetent. I wasn't asking for much, just basic service such as checking in and out in a timely manner.\n5) Bedroom tv had no remote sensor so I had to walk up to it to do anything.\n6) The gym had no weights. Who does cardio in Arizona heat?\n\nOverall, it wasn't THAT bad. It was just a lot of little bad things during my stay; I'm sure it was a fluke / my luck.

Well, since I was starving and all the good restaurants were closed, I didn't have a choice.  I stood in line at the counter and I ordered the turkey sandwich and boy.....was it the best turkey sandwich I've ever tasted!!! I just sat there happy as a lark!  The bread was perfect, the turkey was moist and the ingredients were fresh!  I swear I will never say no to a turkey sandwich for dinner..of course, that's only if it's an Earl of Sandwich!</td></tr><tr><td>HAiaqKcHNtQWwi3jOFc7mA</td><td>-1</td><td>Wish I could give a negative rating for this business! This is probably our 5th stay here and the last one was 2 years ago. They were tolerable before but this weekend has been the worse one. \nRooms/Facility: No elevators. We stayed in a 2BR suite. Requested for a handicap which is to my dismay doesn't have king or queen size beds (twin bed only). There's a coffee maker but no cups. There's a stove but no pan. No microwave. No disposable cups! Hangers provided only when requested. It's very frustrating especially if you're with senior citizens and kids and when you're checking in late because housekeeping service is not avail 24hr and front desk is not very helpful either. We've tried Crestwood, Wyndham and Candlewood Suites before so I do have a point of comparison. \n\nService: 1) we checked in around 10pm and my 82 yr old dad asked where their restroom is. I know for a fact that they do have one because I used it before. The lady (who I regretfully didn't ask the name) bluntly said '\"we don't have public restroom.\" How about that for a welcome greeting? Outright disrespectful! I had to beg and yes I had to. 2) Karen, the revenue manager, is very condescending and unapologetic. She talks to you like you're an idiot and will not extend an apology for their shortcomings. She takes pride for giving mediocre service. She's not the kind of person you want to speak to in the morning to request for supplies.  3) housekeeping is available from 9am-11pm as per Karen. We checked in 10pm on a Friday (holiday weekend) and they denied our request for extra pillows coz the HK is already closed. 2 pillows for a 2-room suite?? We needed to roll our comforter to use as head support. We still gave $tip though. It's not the housekeeping's fault. \nOn the upside: the bed and pillows were comfortable. The facility needs updating especially the handicap shower and chair plus a little fumigation will help too as I've seen 2 cockroaches (No photo sorry). \nEmerald Suites have just gotten from mediocre to worse. Avoid this business at all cost. You've been WARNED.</td></tr><tr><td>vQ0E-vL-K7oGTNkmzzsxQA</td><td>-1</td><td>This Company grossly over charges!

The grill is awful. People are gross and talk inappropriately around customers while they flirt with other staff. We ordered breakfast this morning and they handed us the wrong order. We made it back to my son's room to discover it was wrong. Took it back and they acted like it was our fault we got the wrong order. They had our correct eggs sitting there and gave those to us. . They were cold and they would not make us another. The tables are filthy, the cashiers are rude and unfriendly. The salad is over priced and had a funky after taste. We've essentially lived here for the last four months and I'd rather not eat at all than go down there. I brought my son good up from them one day and there was a nice black hair in there. Disgusting. My son is going through chemo, and there are so many germs we carry in our hair the good ended up in the trash. Avoid them.

They made us feel like we were their only customer... Wait,  we were.  Th  restaurant was empty.  I suspect the do more carryout than anything.  The food was nothing special,  in my opinion.  It wasn't awful but it wasn't anything special either.  While we were sitting there an older man with a Cain came in and stood by the door for about five minutes and after he waited for someone to come to the  front to acknowledge him,  he left. They definitely lack on customer service.  When other customers came in,  there was no greeting or welcome, just \"do you have a pick up order\"  which was yelled from across the restaurant.  The lady at the  bar leaned over the  bar with her coat on playing with her phone as well pretty much the whole time we were there .  I wasn't a fan of the vinyl sticky table cloths either.</td></tr><tr><td>Ji4di888aHaeI3aKEYN0Mg</td><td>-1</td><td>Originally when this place first opened I gave it 5 stars. It was a nice addition to The Tatum Ranch community. It was nice, clean, the food was good and people were friendly. \n\nUnfortunately,I had to change my rating to one star and that is only because the pancakes were yummy. Everything else went down hill. My friend and I went in yesterday after a bike ride and the place was filthy. There was food on the floor under tables and booths, sections of the floor were dirty and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. The women's bathroom was gross and again looked like it hadn't been cleaned, and this wasn't just dirt from the morning. The table next to us had pieces of melon and food under the table,but when it was cleaned off and re set, no one bothered to sweep up the food. There was another table that got up and had scramble eggs on the floor  underneath were the kids were sitting. They cleaned the table, set it and sat another group there without ever touching the floor. It was so bad the waitress was walking through the eggs. \n\nI had said something to the manager, who just gave me a dumb stare,said ok, and never made a move to do anything. It wasn't until we were leaving that a bus boy finally came out with a dust pan and broom. It is going to take alot more that a dust pan and broom to clean it up. If they want to make it in a place were restaurants are on every corner, they better clean up their act. People will start to notice how dirty is is and not come back, like us. We won't be back until we know it has been cleaned up.</td></tr><tr><td>HKJjtxGlC7gNuwsUPDiSYQ</td><td>-1</td><td>As far as the atmosphere goes,it was nice. Sat out on the patio which,even though it was pretty hot out, was cool from the mist system.There was a guy playing the steel drums which was very nice also. The food,although good, was way over priced for what you got. The tuna appetizer was mosltly avocado with one small layer of tuna around the top. The jerk chicken entree was a pretty good size but the thai shrimp and scallop entree was disappointing. There were three scallops that were just average in size and three shrimp that were really small. The flavor was good, but for what you paid for it, the scallops and shrimp should have been much larger. Basically you are paying to eat at Tommy Bahama.

They had a disgusting watery taste to them. The gravy was barely warm and lumpy. Probably from a can. Because the fries were so thin, they got soggy from the crappy gravy and watery lobster.

Oysters during dinner were a decent value. Besides that everything else is disappointing. Chinese...boring. General Tso's Chicken tastes weird. BBQ Pork buns were not authentic. Pretty crappy Chinese fare actually. Italian? Forget about it...crappy pizza and vegetable lasagna. Indian.... Meh you get better Indian food at a local Indian buffet. Fried chicken? Over fried and probably double fried since they were hard as a rock and not juicy and tender. Mexican? Another meh... Prime Rib was decent. Having lived in the Midwest. Definitely not in the very good category. Not to bad though. I was highly unimpressed with this place. Everything was average to below average. Crab legs, oysters, and shrimp were the only positives. Even the clams and mussels didn't taste that great.\n\nDessert...wow was I disappointed. Cheesecake was lame. Their Gelato was pretty good. \n\nFor lunch $25.99 on the strip. It was ok value.

They have a decent selection of bath bombs and bath bars (one of the employees did a little demo for us) and a nice range of shampoo and conditioner bars, and masks. Barely a minute after I walked in I had a sales lady come up to me and ask if I was looking for anything specific, I told her that I was not really looking for anything in particular, just looking around. \n\nI assumed she would leave, but she stood there and talked about the various products they offered, and then took us to the other side of the store to do a demo for us and showed us bath bombs and then asked us which ones we wanted (I wasn't looking to buy anything that day, but would have if something really caught my fancy). I said I was not sure (I don't like to make impulse buys), she came back once or twice a few minutes later to ask us which bath bombs we selected and proceeded to tell us about her life. \n\nI am a fairly patient person but this was getting a bit annoying,. I understand that they have to be friendly but honestly, leave the customer alone. To cut a long story short, I went in just to browse around for a few minutes, ended up being talked to for about 30 minutes by all 4 employees in the store, who told me about their hopes and dreams, so I decided to just buy a bath bomb so they would leave me alone (one of the employees managed to stop me before I even got in the checkout line to try to sell me another product, and then started talking about herself and her college life, nice girl but I am really just looking to leave). By this point I was thoroughly frustrated, not aided by the cashier lady trying to sell me a bath bar. I probably will not go back.\n\nI love Lush but the employees were a bit much for me.</td></tr><tr><td>kbRui5UVclUlipt9VXlxlw</td><td>-1</td><td>Overall, the store itself is a little small but that isn't really a big deal . My issue is with the fact that they sell store bought pre packaged ice cream. The cookies were very average. You're better off buying Chips Ahoy cookies and Blue Bell or Tillamook ice cream from the store. I personally don't see the point of selling something I could buy at Safeway for cheaper. It takes away from the concept of them selling reasonably priced ice cream sandwiches if I can make the same thing for much less.

The rooms were spacious and clean and everything was well kept.  The staff was friendly every time we walked past the front desk.\n\nOur flight didn't arrive to Charlotte until 11:40pm on Friday night. That meant that we didn't get to the hotel until 1am Saturday morning.  As we pulled up to the hotel we quickly realized that we were smack dab in the middle of party central.  The restaurant across the street was apparently a night club as well.  There was a line out the door and around the corner and down the block to get in.  The hotel was crawling with both police officers and security (kudos to hotel management for making sure the place was safe at least).  Once we made it to our room on the 15th floor we spent the next hour listening to screams and yells from drunk club goers 15 floors below us.  Cars would drive by with stereo systems so loud that the glasses on our night stands would vibrate.  Every 10 minutes it seemed like someone felt the need to either over rev their motorcycle and bounce off of the rev limiter (I guess showing people that you can twist your wrist on a throttle like EVERYONE ELSE in the world makes you some sort of hot shot?) or do the same to their car.  This would usually be followed by that same vehicle attempting to peel out from the stop light at the corner.  All of this while drunk club goers are undoubtedly stumbling only inches away on the sidewalks.\n\nFast forward to the day on Saturday.  We awoke to grab some breakfast then hit up a bicycle store to get a part for my bike since I was going to be racing a major national race that evening at 6pm.  Our plan was to eat a big breakfast then go back to sleep in order for me to be well rested for my race.  Little did I know that when we got back to the hotel and climbed back into bed around noon we would be kept up by what was apparently repairs being done to the plumbing or other piping on the 14th floor, right beneath us.  Workers were banging on pipes constantly for hours.  We tried to nap but simply couldn't.  We left a couple of hours later to grab an early pre-race meal and made it back around 3pm.  The banging didn't stop until 4-4:30.  So much for any form of a nap.  I thought I would get some rest being in a hotel?\n\nFast forward again to Saturday night/Sunday morning and the same events from the previous night were far, far, FAR worse.  Apparently some DJ decided to set up on a corner or something and proceeded to play dance music until 2am, on the dot.  More screaming and yelling than the night before.  More vehicles with motors bouncing off of rev limiters and, no doubt, blowing speakers in a vain attempt to show others how cool they are by playing overly distorted music through craptastic sub-par car audio equipment.  All to be up at 4am on Sunday morning in order to catch my 6am flight back home.\n\nI will never, let me emphasize this: I WILL NEVER stay at this hotel or at any hotel in the vicinity again.  Annoyed doesn't even begin to describe my level of irritation.  Hotel management should be ashamed that they A) let this happen right outside of their doors B) put paying customers on an exterior part of the building where they are subjected to this kind of noise.</td></tr><tr><td>FivoUZQnUAfhQwdwTRZmOQ</td><td>-1</td><td>I remember now why we never eat here anymore.

I've only had their lunch special ($6) and it comes with an array of things. Its not the best Caribbean place but its not bad and its a really good deal. For the chicken, you have a choice of jerk, BBQ, fried, and baked. The meat on the jerk chicken really falls off the bone and its a good expected spice level. I found the fried chicken a little too salty on some of the skin bits though. I like that you get a bunch of extra stuff like chick peas, greens, and the bread thing. It's a nice variety that you don't normally get from a typical Caribbean place.

It could use some updating (Torn booths, presentation) and I had texted my wife before we started eating, \"We are here eating at Chang's in case I get food poisoning\" because I thought there might be some problems.  The buffet was small and there was a small dessert section (three items- Chocolate pudding, Jello, and canned peaches).  The owner/cashier/server was really nice, even explaining to my friend what was in some of the choices he made.  I liked the sesame chicken, orange chicken, walnut shrimp, and the fried rice with pieces of ham.  The staff was really attentive and made sure our used plates were quickly off our table and refills were consistent.  Overall not a bad experience, but the first impression was a little shady.  On a side note, I did end up getting food poisoning, but I am unsure if it was the alcohol later or the food, but I did end up on the toilet from 3am to later at our hotel room (see my motel 6 review for a little more info).

I think I will stick yo the slightly more pricey My Thai Bowl and get more flavorful quality food.</td></tr><tr><td>U-t2Oin4pOEqD2EUsIAydg</td><td>-1</td><td>Worst company EVER \nThere are so many companies to choose from in the valley, so if your looking for prest control, make sure you go to ANY other company than this one!\nSo unreliable, it's actually a joke. \nI had a scheduled visit for termite inspection, on a warrantied job, so, obviously they already got our money when they treated, and a year ago, and need a reinspection done. I had a appointment for a Saturday, On Friday, the company called and said the inspector had a personal emergency and needed to reschedule for Sunday. No problem. I understand things can happen. On Sunday, I waisted my entire day waiting for my call to say he was on his way, with a 5 hour window to wait, to get a call 3 hours into my scheduled time only for him to say he can't make it, and needs to reschedule AGAIN.

I got scammed into booking a convertible into what looked like $29 a night from an online ad by them, but came out to be  $80 with all the hidden charges then when I arrived to check in they told me I needed to have proof of insurance.  I handed the man at the counter my insurance card and he said I need to call them to confirm.  He then came back 5 minutes later with, \"Your insurance co. is closed on sunday so I cannot give you the car to rent because I need proof that you have insurance\"  Me, \"are you serious read my insurance card you foreign IDIOT!!!!!\"  I was so angry esp. because I had already booked this online and PAID!  He said Im sorry there is nothing we can do.  Well Please give me a print out of my full refund.  Him', \"You have to call this number, there is nothing I can do\"  .... literally then he said next in line.... OMG I have never been so mistreated and angry at the same time.  This place needs to be shut down its ghetto, trashy, run like shit, and a complete joke!  AGAIN STAY AWAY this place will only hassle you and waste your time!

Probably the easiest breakfast you can make or get unless you eat a banana for breaky.\n\nThe eggs came over hard-as-nails, 1 slice of toast, 2 scrappy pieces of bacon(undercooked) and a tiny portion of homefries...all for 11.50.\n\na 12 dollar breakfast should be more or at the bare minimum at least be well cooked, half decent food.\n\nI found it really overpriced, bad food and bad service (I waited 40 minutes for the breakfast on top of waiting 20 minutes to get a coffee).\n\nAvoid unless you have money to burn, time to kill and want to leave still feeling hungry.</td></tr><tr><td>nIX6wtaa5OYF9eBi1C1wTQ</td><td>-1</td><td>I got the jerk pork roti...portion size was good, but the meat inside was bland and flavorless...its was almost like beef stew wrapped in a roti shell, which was stale and tough.

Only 11 out of 26.2 miles were enjoyable (some are debatable). The course ran you out into 'God Knows Where' where there were no spectators, barely any volunteers, barely any water stops, no course marshals, no mile-markers and no time mechanisms....much less any form of entertainment as the series name and gloatings might suggest. \n\nAside from 'minor' complaints of not having enough entertainment throughout the course, how can a company host a marathon with an insufficient number of water stops - especially when the marathon is in the desert. On top of that, the Rock n Roll company refused to have an appropriate number of medical tents, strategically placed ambulances and cops along the full marathon course?! This specific full marathon is downright dangerous. It's a hazard to your health. But then, why would corporate America care about your health anyway as it's all about having the best ROI at the end of the day and your health jeopardizes that bottom line figure.\n\nI highly suggest NOT running the RnR Las Vegas full marathon to ANY runner (first timer or marathon vet). Save your $100+, get the most bang for your buck and run a different marathon, one where the company putting on the race gives 2 cents about the actual runners running the race (and not just the VP of running).</td></tr><tr><td>0BG7EnAbQiqoEA9K9u-SfQ</td><td>-1</td><td>Let me preface this review with the fact that I go to Chipotle a lot.  I went there for lunch today and got a steak burrito and put the usual rice, beans, Pico, cheese, sour cream, and I get guac on the side.  The steak had barely any flavor and was very chewy.  It was like half of my pieces were gristle.  The guacamole I put on the burrito with a fork because they slop it on otherwise; it had no flavor and the color was off as well.  I pretty much go to Chipotle for the guacamole and this was the worst I had.  $10 for this burrito was way overpriced and I ended up throwing much of it away because of the lack of flavor.  The line was so long I didn't want to complain but this makes me think twice about visiting this location.</td></tr><tr><td>cIrZqZoxmXNhmC1n2u3UqQ</td><td>-1</td><td>If I could give zero stars I would.

We got the enchiladas with red sauce and it was the most foul tasting red sauce.  The sauce was over salty and had a strange taste to it.  The rice was also terrible. The only redeeming quality of this place is the salsa and the friendly wait staff.</td></tr><tr><td>hb2tLSp2qOBH50IyK_yVrA</td><td>-1</td><td>This is the second time I've participated on the Tour in two years. There are many reasons to go on this tour: 1) the RRST Team is very customer service-oriented, from scheduling, to pick-up, to providing insight about the areas on the way to the tour site, excellent instruction for scooter newbies, information about the Canyon through ensuring everyone's safety and comfort on the trip; 2) It gets you off The Strip and provides you with beautiful vistas of the Las Vegas area and 3) The camaraderie among the RRST team and participants is entertaining.\n\nIt was nice to experience the same level of fun this time as with the first. I am a photographer and love the stops along the way to stop and take pictures. They have switched over to easier to drive scooters, too.\n\nIf you've never ridden a scooter don't be reluctant to sign-up, my group had 10 participants who had never been on a scooter and all of them did really well. My only advice if you take the tour during the cooler/cold months please dress appropriately. Although RRST provides gloves, windbreakers and helmets with built-in visors, it can get cold. Don't let the warmer temps on The Strip fool you.\n\nWhen I head to Vegas again I will be signing up for my 3rd Tour.</td></tr><tr><td>L0amZ-ghRnNsZcjvH-ZZ8g</td><td>-1</td><td>Awwww MAN!!!!!\n\nThe open Mic'ers will miss you guys!\nThanks for letting us all play!!</td></tr><tr><td>5NbVFRIvrKlKd3uxa0u88Q</td><td>-1</td><td>WARNING!!!!\nIf you come here and get the waitress with the do-rag, resting bitch face and the nicotine patch.......MOVE SECTIONS IMMEDIATELY.  \n\nREQUEST IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF SECTION, get your own drinks or go to the kitchen to deliver your own food.\n\nWe sat in amazement with this girl.

In fact we went here because everyone told us how good the burgers are. It was definitely over hyped. \n\nFor our appetizer we ordered the gallettes which are basically glorified crackers with some olive and bacon bits and melted cheese. Tomatoes are also haphazardly arranged on around the crackers and then a slice of cucumber and radish in the middle. It's really odd. There were also no caramelized onions on ours either. \n\nI ordered the burger las brisas for my entree. The burger itself tasted really yummy, but everything else was a mess. I love spicy and am no stranger to jalapeÃ±o, but these had a funny taste and were out of this world spicy. I also really didn't like that they sort of pressed the burger. It literally disintegrated. The salsa was just chunks of tomato. There was a good amount of avocado which was nice. \n\nI was so under whelmed by the experience, it's such a beautiful restaurant and I wanted to love it. It was over priced and didn't deliver. Plus the service was slow. I really want to come back but I just don't have a reason to!</td></tr><tr><td>E0Bx47y38gRJrgaX5ST90A</td><td>-1</td><td>Don't waste your money, this place is ridiculously over priced for what you actually get. There were three of us, two got a drink, and it was $33. \n\n We ordered a Reuben sandwich, there were only three small slices of corned beef on the entire sandwich! A Reuben is supposed to feature mainly the beef! Luckily it tasted pretty good, but you can't recover from a $10 sandwich (with no drink and stale potato chips) that has no meat! They also put onions on their Reuben, which feels like a sin. That's just not a Reuben, which is I guess why it's with the paninis, but still. \n\nThe French Dip had the exact same problem, absolutely no meat, except it was worse because it had no flavor either. I love au jus more than anything, I've actually never met an au jus I didn't like, but this one lacked any sort of flavor. \n\nThen the chips, I'm not sure if they were house chips or what. I can't describe them adequately because they were a mixture of soggy but stale. It was weird. \n\nTLDR: Over priced. Not enough meat. Soggy/stale house chips. Okay taste.</td></tr><tr><td>A5DXuWF1NCGHaAxwxlS6fQ</td><td>-1</td><td>I have never experienced such rude customer service. That's sucks because the food was actually pretty good.

Scotch eggs with chorizo was a lovely Spanish twist on the old Ecosse classic. Then came along mini burgers made with chicken and mediterranean seasoning and a fresh baked bun. We did get a beet and goat cheese salad, cauliflower seasoned with truffle oil and that was enough to call these little plates a FULL meal! At no point were we forgotten as more patrons came in with return visits to fill our glasses and invitations to stay and enjoy ourselves even after we'd paid our tab. A small bowl of sweets arrived despite our refusal to order dessert-what a nice touch (which we devoured anyways).\nWhat else can I add here? The decor was thoughtfully chosen and the vibe of Sorocco was laid back and inviting. Oh and the prices were very fair considering the quality and service!</td></tr><tr><td>Bj_QkngcBHSdbDEJTih__Q</td><td>-1</td><td>Incredibly disappointed in this company. My 77 year old father contacted them to have a wine fridge repaired. After paying the $95 service charge(COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS) for the 5 minute appt, the employee said \"oh yes it's absolutely worth fixing\". We were informed we needed a cold air something or other.  \nFor the last 3 weeks, my father has called to try and get updates on what the status is of the part, to which he either received \"oh next week\" or no return call at all. I finally called this morning, because at this point I feel like they took advantage of a 77 year old man. I asked for a manager only to be told the name of the person who answered the phone again. I explained the situation and was asked for my fathers name. To which the employee said sarcastically \"oh yea...\". Yes, he has been calling your company REPEATEDLY to get some answers from you! \nI was immediately told the part can't be found and to junk the wine fridge. \nI then called the manufacturer of the fridge and was told the fridge and all the parts were discontinued. So, for 3 weeks my father has been getting the run around and it's because \"I was exhausting all avenues\" and \"yeah $95 is the service call charge\" TO GET NO RESOLUTION and apparently an employee who has no idea what they are talking about. Terrible customer service. Your customers should not have to call you to get answers, especially not a simple one. All you had to do was keep in touch, instead you ignored and now I had to write a nasty review. Unacceptable. Should have checked Yelp before we called you, this is apparently your companies norm.</td></tr><tr><td>ZMVZA_EAvZ0sZJTFPGCXYw</td><td>-1</td><td>Very disappointed - went one night the food & service were both terrible!

However, on our last visit (we were getting married that weekend), we received incredibly rude service from a woman in the cabana suites. She was harassing us repeatedly about smoking just because one of us had a vape in our hands. We did not smoke indoors, but she made a point to stop us and harass us in a rude demeanor each time we walked by the front desk. I eventually became upset enough to return the rudeness. I'm a little disappointed that we were treated this way on our wedding day. Also a little sad that as much as we stay here, we never receive discount offers from this place. I will certainly be looking into other places to stay.</td></tr><tr><td>DS5Kl3Brz1NJVdKTmYkfUA</td><td>-1</td><td>Unfortunately this place is three and a half hours from me in Las Vegas.

We shop at this location quite often because my BF's favorite brand is sold here. They have plenty of items to choose from that will suit your style. We always find good deals on men's clothing more than women's. The store is easy to shop and the racks aren't over crowded with product. The associates are young, but there are plenty of them around if you need assistance with the fitting room. There are never a lot of people shopping when we visit, so we never have to wait at the register.

The pharmacy staff is friendly enough and I never have to wait an excessive amount of time. I also use their photo department to have pictures printed using their app. Prices for photos are cheap and there is always a promo code online to get them even cheaper. I had 64 4x6 photos printed and only paid around $14. The app can also be utilized to track your prescriptions and view the current ad/promotions.

Be prepared for lots of laughs and random facts that might shock you. \n\nSeriously I don't even know where to start describing what's inside this place. Of course, lots of sex wherever you turn. My favorite was the board where visitors write their dirty secrets, and yes, I did write something on there. Sex has evolved so much and it's so crazy to see how much it has changed (like how hairy everyone was.) There's a whole section dedicated to sex machines, um ouch! There was even a workshop taking place on how to practice safe bondage techniques. Upstairs, there is actual porn playing in one of the exhibit booths. Even a whole section dedicated to homosexual practices. Everything was sooo interesting!! \n\nI enjoyed my time here!! I love learning about new things, especially when it's about sex.

I can honestly say that I really do love this store. They have aisles and aisles of stuff that are super organized. Items dedicated to feeding, baby gear (strollers/car seats), bathing and diapers are on the left side of the store. The clothing and furniture departments are in the middle. Bedding, decor and toys are on the right side. It's always been super quiet during my visits, so I've never had an issue with items being out of stock. I have never had to wait in line at the register for long. I had my baby registry here and it was a super easy process for returns and purchased. And they have a rewards card where you accumulate points, which then turns into $ off your future purchases. So why only the 3 star rating? Prices for items can be ridiculous. I've seen the exact same items at Target for much cheaper. But I can see visits here in my near future since they have items that I've only seen at this store. So alas, I will be back, spending $$ on my son and his needs.</td></tr><tr><td>MvZvuNDw6debNNGbXgUGPg</td><td>-1</td><td>I was on a mission for black pumps and I knew they had it here.

STILL NO HELLO from any of them! I know they get credit for sales and you would think since I was trying them on that they would at least have acknowledged me. I loved the shoes but walked out due to the lack of no customer service. And if I was going to spend $100+ on pumps, I would at least have gotten a hello.
