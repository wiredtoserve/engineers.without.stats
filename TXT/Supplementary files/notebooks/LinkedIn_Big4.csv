Today, I strive to apply my knowledge of accounting, finance, and management to solve business problems. However, I was not always this way….When I was a child, my dream was to pilot an A-10 Warthog for the United States Air Force. Sadly, I do not possess 20/20 vision, the muscle to do hundreds of one-handed push-ups, nor the stomach for roller coaster rides. (Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters is actually my favorite Disneyland attraction.) Therefore, upon entering college in 2008, I identified my own competitive advantages: solid analytical and problem-solving talent, strong verbal communication skills, and an ability to understand the details in the context of the big picture--so I pursued a career path in business. I quickly developed a love of financial markets and have never looked back.In Spring 2012, I graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Hawaii at Manoa with a triple-major in Finance, Accounting, and International Business, and a double-minor in Economics and Chinese. My coursework, leadership in student-led clubs, and participation in international competitions allowed me to develop knowledge focused on financial analysis and financial accounting. This is reflected on my transcript by straight A+ marks in every finance course (24 credit hours) and upper-division financial accounting course (9 credit hours) that I took at the Shidler College of Business.I am currently in the process of earning the CPA, CFA, and CMA charters to increase my ability to understand clients' problems and provide them with targeted high-value services and solutions.

Within me is a buring desire to create, to build and to make things better. In the process, I have consulted with Fortune 50 companies, built agencies, created brands and spent the better half of age eight naively attempting to turn my grandmother's 13-inch black and white television into a color monitor. I ruined it, by the way, save a single, potentially (but unverified) greenish line across the middle of the screen.In 1994 myself and two other visionary souls (now famed entrepreneurs David Kidder and Steve Skewes) started and built an interactive design studio tragically named: Net-X. Propelled by a drive to understand the new digital frontier and an odd and illusive partnership with Silicon Graphics, we became a success known for web-authoring software services, serving clients such as Xerox, Bausch & Lomb, Ray Ban and Young & Rubicam. In March of 1996, we sold Net-X to Target Vision and thus began a love affair with building companies.Since then, I have spent the vast majority of my professional life designing brand experiences (both digital and traditional) for consumer retail businesses while getting B2B companies to treat their customers like human beings.Along the way, I've worked with and learned from some unique characters, including James Wondrack (who taught me about the art of detail, the purpose of things and the awareness of physical objects in thinking about designing brands in a flat medium), Dave Rollert (from whom I am reminded to always be curious, even in the face of corporate thinking), Karen Dawson (who believes in leading gracefully and taught me to find inspiration in everything), Tony Fross (who is still teaching me about the human world and the art of communication) and Giles Dickerson (who teaches us all to connect with what we do and stay away from that which is not honest or authentic).",327,0.3,0.7,0.33,0.67,0.56,0.44,0.74,0.26
