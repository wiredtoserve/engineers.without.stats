in-jurgenschut,"Amsterdam Area, Netherlands",Management consulting,July 2006,Partner,SeederDeBoer,KPMG,"Vraagstukken waarin verschillende culturen bij elkaar komen, daarvan gaat mijn hart sneller kloppen. Bijvoorbeeld bij een fusie, of het vormen van een shared service center. Dergelijke veranderingen hebben een grote impact op mensen. Zij hebben een vorm gevonden waarin ze plezierig werken. Dan wordt er besloten tot het vormen van een nieuwe organisatie. De solide basis valt weg en de groep moet een nieuw perspectief vormen. Bovendien moet er op hetzelfde moment hard gewerkt worden aan nieuwe structuren, processen en systemen. Met behoud van resultaat natuurlijk. Wil een organisatie dat bereiken, dan zal niet alleen de inhoud in orde moeten zijn. Minstens even belangrijk is het dat er voldoende aandacht is voor de mensen in de organisatie.Als extern adviseur wil ik werkelijk betrokken zijn bij de organisatie van de klant. In complexe strategische projecten staat vertrouwen tussen mensen centraal. Open discussies voeren en samen tot de kern komen. Ik ben dan ook graag veel bij mijn klanten, zodat ik een goed gevoel krijg voor wat er speelt. In het informele circuit hoor je pas echt wat mensen bezighoudt; waar ze trots op zijn en waar de weerstand zich bevindt. In combinatie met workshops en andere bijeenkomsten die wij organiseren, helpt mij dit om inzicht te krijgen in het collectieve perspectief. Dat vormt de basis voor de inrichting van het veranderproces en de uitvoering daarvan.Waar ik me altijd sterk voor maak, is het vermijden van keurslijven. Het maakt een organisatie structureel beter als mensen de ruimte krijgen om zelfstandig te handelen. Dat betekent niet dat er geen regels moeten zijn. Zonder grenzen immers geen vrijheid. Maar daarbinnen wil ik mensen prikkelen hun capaciteiten optimaal in te zetten en hun eigen pad te gaan. Op deze manier kan de kracht van het collectief ingezet worden om de beste resultaten te boeken."

Daarbij is het voor mij mooi om nu -bij PNO- deel uit te mogen maken van een breed team aan experts en ter zake kundige specialisten die mij steunen, helpen en complementeren.Op subsidiegebied geloof ik in het leveren van een totaaloplossing. In het faciliteren van onderzoek binnen uw bedrijf of instelling, van fundamenteel onderzoek tot meer toegepaste wetenschap en alles daartussenin. Daarbij zijn samen en duurzaam voor mij de sleutelwoorden in de klant-consultant relatie.De WBSO/RDA vormt in mijn optiek een mooi instrument omdat het een regelmatig contact-moment levert. Uitgaande van de WBSO/RDA kunnen we dan samen vervolgens effectief doorschakelen naar andere subsidiemogelijkheden, van innovatiebox tot Europese Unie.Als gepromoveerd moleculair bioloog/biochemicus met aardig wat internationale kilometers op mijn teller versta ik als geen ander de complexe vraagstukken waarmee uw R&D afdeling wordt geconfronteerd. Ik begrijp de wetenschap achter de onderzoeksvraag en kan het jargon effectief en succesvol vertalen in een tekst die de subsidieverstrekkers (zoals bv. AgentschapNL en NWO) verstaan.In de avonduren studeer ik rechten aan de Vrije Universiteit. Daarbij maak ik deel uit van het honours-programma voor top-studenten in Amsterdam. Uiteindelijk hoop ik mijn master te halen in ondernemingsrecht, met een focus op ‘intellectual property’ en/of ‘incorporation’. Op termijn hoop ik dan ook een nog breder servicepakket te kunnen bieden en als consultant mensen verder te kunnen helpen met de vraagstukken die aan het hart liggen van elk R&D bedrijf: het patentportfolio en de verdere financiering van R&D-activiteiten.Hieronder heb ik een aantal van mijn mooiste wetenschappelijke publicaties geplaatst.
